Racist thuggery has no place on our streets. Anyone attacking the police will be met with full force of the law. These marches & protests have been subverted by violence and breach current guidelines. Racism has no part in the UK and we must work together to make that a reality.

The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country     and the whole of Europe     from a fascist and racist tyranny. 1/8

"We must all continue to remember those on the frontline battling this disease, and members of society who are vulnerable - and continue to do all we can to stop the spread of coronavirus. 
 
By doing the right thing and following the rules, you are helping to save lives."

"I want to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all carers in the UK helping us through this pandemic. 
 
Whether you work as a carer, or are caring for someone at home, your compassion and strength at this time is a beacon of hope for us all.

People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.

"Together we have made it through the peak, but we ۪re not yet back to normal.

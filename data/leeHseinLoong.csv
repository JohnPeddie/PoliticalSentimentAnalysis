The Marina Reservoir & Marina Barrage protect the city area from flooding, but we need other solutions for the eastern coastline. We have looked at other countries for inspiration. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/25Dz90pmUt"

"PM Lee: So the third thing we must do is adapt to climate change, especially rising sea levels. We need local measures to protect buildings, but these will not be enough as we have many older buildings, and large parts of Singapore are low-lying. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: Everyone has a role to play to promote sustainability, like remembering to switch off the lights, and reduce waste. We may not be able to stop climate change by ourselves, but we must do our part. Unfortunately, a global solution is still far off. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/VBKyul7gFG"

"PM Lee: Second, we must mitigate climate change. We have joined intl efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. We have committed to slow down & ultimately cap emissions, under the Paris Climate Agreement. We introduced a carbon tax last yr to help achieve this. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: What can we do? First, we must understand what climate change means for Singapore. Researchers from Centre for Climate Research Singapore found that being near the equator, we are more vulnerable to climate change than the global model suggests. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/xwnVKERgSH"

"PM Lee: Why should we be concerned abt climate change? The Earth�۪s average temperature is already up 1 deg C from 100 yrs ago. Weather gets more extreme ��� more severe droughts, more intense rainfall. Singapore is already feeling the impact. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/OiqKPAFAA5"

"PM Lee: Next, let me talk about how we can renew our city & our home for the next century, and beyond. I will start with climate change. It may seem abstract and distant, but it is one of the gravest challenges facing humankind. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/Dl74eOSeaP"

"PM Lee: All these changes ��� to Retirement Age, Re-employment Age, CPF rates ��� will support older workers to continue working longer & to be more financially independent. One more point, to be clear ��� we are not making any changes to CPF withdrawal policies or ages! #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: We will also start raising both Retirement & Re-employment Age from 2022. By 2030, we should reach Retirement Age of 65, & Re-employment Age of 70. Govt will help businesses adjust through support package. Govt will also take the lead in this, for public officers. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: The Government will accept the Workgroup�۪s recommendations in full. Tdy, CPF rates for workers taper down from age 55. We will gradually raise rates over next 10 yrs, so rates will only taper down from age 60, and level off after 70. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: @MOM_sg set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers. They made 4 recommendations:
1) Raise Retirement Age from 62 to 65
2) Raise Re-employment Age from 67 to 70
3) Raise CPF contributions for older workers
4) Achieve all this in gradual steps, by about 2030.

"PM Lee: Seniors want to remain active & engaged, & some want to build up a bigger nest egg for retirement. Enabling seniors to continue working productively takes a joint effort between employers & employees, and the Govt will support this. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/WQDa3wNdwk"

"PM Lee: Our education enables young Singaporeans to get a headstart, but our support doesn�۪t end there. As people progress in their careers, we help keep their skills up to date with SkillsFuture. This is impt as our life expectancy is now the longest in the world! #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: The point of these changes to fees is not just the dollars & cents, but to make our education system as accessible as possible. This is so every Singaporean will have the opportunity to get a good education and start well in life. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: Medicine has the highest course fees of all the uni courses. Even after Govt subsidies, medical school fees are almost $29k/yr at NUS, & $35k/yr at NTU. We do not want the cost to deter good students, so we will enhance govt bursaries for medical school. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/u9tt46T5XJ"

"PM Lee: 2nd, we will also significantly enhance government bursaries ��� for uni students, from 50% to up to 75% for general degree fees; and for polytechnic diploma programmes, from 80% to up to 95%. These fee adjustments will apply from the next academic year (AY2020). #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: @MOEsg did a comprehensive review of tertiary fees & bursaries recently. First, we will lower @singaporetech and @suss_sg fees for their general degree programme from around $8,000 now, to $7,500 annually. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: We piloted KidSTART 3 yrs ago, to give extra help to 1,000 kids from less-privileged families. We are happy with the results, and so are the parents. So we will expand KidSTART to reach another 5,000 kids over the next 3 yrs. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/SnPTZQ1V87"

"PM Lee: We will enhance preschool subsidies to help more families. We�۪ll raise the income ceiling for means-tested subsidies to $12,000/mth, meaning 30,000 more households will qualify. We will also increase the quantum of preschool subsidies, across the board. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/Ov0fxaKiFM"

"PM Lee: 5th, we continue to make preschool more affordable. All parents receive significant subsidies for childcare, with lower-income parents receiving substantially more. Still, for middle income parents, fees can take up a chunk of the household budget. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: 4th, we are giving pre-school teachers better training and career progression. We set up the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) to upgrade training for pre-school teachers, and it enrolled its first students this yr. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/jFCR3OZhKV"

"PM Lee: 3rd, we set up MOE Kindergartens. By operating kindergartens, MOE gains direct experience, and raises industry standards. We have 24 MOE Kindergartens now, and will more than double the number in the next few yrs. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ryYdno98al"

"PM Lee: 2nd, we have also upgraded the pre-schools. New HDB void deck centres are better designed, and we have built mega centres too, like the PCF Sparkletots centre at Punggol. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/egT7l00JNZ"

"What we�۪ve done so far: First, we�۪ve doubled full-day preschool capacity to almost 180,000 since 2012, enough places for every child aged 3 & above. Now, young parents in newer estates like Sengkang & Punggol are happier! #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/hvm8OUBOaI"

"PM Lee: But we are going further. We want to start earlier in a child�۪s life, because these years make a big difference in their development. That is why we made a big shift to improve preschool education several yrs ago. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/kguPBUJRAV"

"PM Lee: In Singapore, anyone who works hard will have a chance to succeed, regardless of starting point or family background. This is what meritocracy is about, and we have made good on this promise by investing heavily in education. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: I want to talk about 3 things in my English speech:

1st, Enabling every young person to succeed
2nd, supporting people to work for longer, as we are living longer
3rd, protecting ourselves from climate change, & renewing our city for the next century.
 
#ndrsg"

"PM Lee: These activities help us appreciate the broader context that�۪s created modern Spore. We have overcome many difficulties in our journey, & adapted to drastic changes in our world. We need this resourcefulness & resolve more than ever. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/axY309qdFY"

"PM Lee: ���Singapore may be a small country, but we have big hearts.�۝ Let us live up to that ambition. Let us continue to stand tall, chase rainbows, and work together for many brighter tomorrows. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/dlnWijg0jS"

"PM Lee: 100 years from now, Singapore should stand out not just for its modern skyscrapers & world rankings, but for being a nation of boundless opportunities. A society where every skill & talent is recognised, developed & celebrated. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/IaSCmlkusO"

"PM Lee: The human spirit must flourish in Singapore. Recently, National Geographic published a special issue on Singapore: City of Tomorrow. The issue celebrates ordinary Singaporeans doing extraordinary things, taking the path less travelled. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ehYjR66a8n"

"PM Lee: Residents will have to vote for VERS, just like for HIP. If residents vote yes, we will proceed. If residents vote no, they can continue to live in their flats until leases run out. This is a long term plan ��� we will not start VERS for another 20 years. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: So what happens to flats that do not get SERS? Govt has good reason to take back more flats and redevelop them before 99 years are up, to renew estate progressively. I will call it VERS ��� Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ZsPDStsYla"

"PM Lee, on SERS: The Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme is good for estate rejuvenation, but it is limited ��� HDB estimates only around 5% of flats are suitable for SERS. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: HIP II will keep these flats safe and liveable, and help them retain their value as their leases run down. The first flats to reach 60-70 years old will be eligible in about 10 years, so that is when we plan to launch HIP II. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: After expanded HIP, these flats should be good for another 30-40 years. By that time, they will be 60-70 yrs old, and will need 2nd round of upgrading. Let�۪s call this HIP II. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/Q1v1L8SpJb"

"PM Lee: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) covers flats built up to 1986. It has been 10 yrs since we launched HIP, so flats which missed qualifying are starting to show their age. So I am happy to announce we will extend HIP to blocks built up to 1997. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/oqUUlNRst4"

"PM Lee: There is one fundamental reason why HDB leases are for 99 yrs - we need to be fair to future generations. If the Govt sold land on freehold, sooner or later we would run out of land to build new flats for future generations. #ndrsg"

PM Lee: Singapore�۪s housing policies have been uniquely successful ��� we are the only major city in the world where nearly every young couple getting married can afford to buy their first home immediately. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/XWK6Q0k6RJ

"PM Lee: Many Singaporeans are also concerned about housing ��� but house prices affect people differently. When you want to buy a house, you want prices to be low. But when you want to sell, you want prices to be high! #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ay8I4gKmH2"

"PM Lee: The Govt will work out a ���Merdeka Generation Package�۝ ��� which will help meet their medical expenses. It will cover similar areas as the PGP, e.g.

- Outpatient subsidies
- MediSave top ups
- MediShield Life premium subsidies; and
- Payouts for long term care. 

#ndrsgpic.twitter.com/rMsPQDJSO8"

"PM Lee: When we introduced PGP, we knew there were Singaporeans a little younger than the Pioneers who would just miss out. They are mostly in their 60s, and have similar healthcare concerns as Pioneers, worried about having enough for medical needs. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/pAbC8KjgKV"

"PM Lee: We are taking special care of elderly Singaporeans. We launched the Pioneer Generation Package 4yrs ago to help them. So far, 450,000 have benefited, and we have spent more than $1.3b of the $8b we set aside. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/GedIev6Bm5"

"PM Lee: These are some of the major changes over the last few yrs so that all Singaporeans have access to affordable, high quality healthcare. No one should be denied medical care because they cannot afford it. That is my commitment to you. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/lL1QoOfsmu"

"PM Lee: ElderShield will be revamped into CareShield Life in 2020, and cover all Singaporeans born in 1980 & younger. It will pay out at least $600 a month, and for as long as you live ��� not just 6 yrs. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/Uqekb1ILeR"

"PM Lee: We have improved financial support for long-term care. We have the ElderShield scheme, which pays a monthly sum of $300 or $400 for up to 6 yrs if you cannot do 3 Activities of Daily Living (e.g. dressing or feeding yourself). #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/Q0VnIZwSGn"

"PM Lee: CHAS has worked well. As we grow older, more of us will have chronic conditions. Currently, CHAS covers middle & lower income Singaporeans. We will now extend CHAS to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, regardless of income. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/5nbtd2oqRS"

"PM Lee: We have made changes to improve affordability in recent yrs ��� we upgraded MediShield to MediShield Life; & also introduced the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), which provides generous subsidies, especially for the lower income. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/TI3hqglCKN"

"PM Lee: How have we kept healthcare spending affordable? Our 3M framework ��� MediSave, MediShield & MediFund. Govt also provides heavy subsidies ��� up to 80% in hospitals. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/JQcrEhq0tE"

PM Lee: Singaporeans are indeed spending more on healthcare ��� partly because we have more advanced treatment & equipment. But a bigger reason is because we are living longer and growing older. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ejqkT10mMa

"PM Lee: I�۪ve often spoken about education at previous NDRs, and I spoke quite a bit about preschool education last yr. This year, I will talk about healthcare and housing, starting with healthcare. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: 3 major expenditure items ��� housing, education & healthcare ��� affect our cost of living in a big way. The Govt is very focused on these, & we will spare no effort to ensure you can afford them. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: I spoke about cost of living pressures earlier ��� what causes them, what the Govt is doing, and how you can stretch your dollar. I explained how we are helping people cope with water and electricity bills through U-Save rebates. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: On domestic developments, Singapore�۪s economy is still growing steadily despite an uncertain external environment. Our efforts to transform our economy are making progress. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: Ultimately, the fundamentals of our relationship w/ M�۪sia have not changed. We need to work together to tackle common challenges & find constructive ways to resolve our differences. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: Dr Mahathir & his team are determined to review & change many policies set by the previous Malaysian Govt. This will affect our ongoing projects, like the HSR & RTS Link to Johor. Dr Mahathir also wants to review our 1962 Water Agreement. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: Malaysia�۪s new PM is not new to us. We completed several impt projects with Malaysia under Dr Mahathir. I told him I wanted to work with him to take our bilateral relationship forward, & he agreed we should. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/vXdbVkoXqr"

"PM Lee: Indonesia will hold elections next year. I have worked well with President Jokowi. We have wide-ranging cooperation with Indonesia, and I hope this will continue. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ne6NHhOWQZ"

"PM Lee: In an uncertain world, ASEAN is all the more important to us. We have to strengthen ASEAN and work on our relationships with all ASEAN partners, especially our 2 closest neighbours, Indonesia & Malaysia. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/MhJFwDl8qM"

"PM Lee: Global trade frictions have sharpened tensions between countries. There are no winners in a trade war, and small, open economies are especially vulnerable. Singapore will suffer collateral damage. #ndrsg"

"PM Lee: We hope the Summit has helped defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, but it is not the only trouble spot. The world situation has become more uncertain ��� openness, globalisation & free trade have all come under pressure. #ndrsg"

PM Lee: I would also like to thank all Singaporeans who made an extra effort to show what Singapore could do. Organising the Summit brought us all together. We have every reason to feel proud of ourselves! #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/pmEhlLjAO7

"PM Lee: Why were we chosen? I think because they saw us as serious and reliable. It was a daunting task, but we rose to the challenge. I want to thank the officers and your families once again, personally. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/iFcgXmx6jg"

"PM Lee: We have had a busy yr, at home and internationally. 2 mths ago, we hosted the 1st ever mtg between a US President & DPRK Chairman. As host we had a responsibility to ensure Summit proceeded smoothly. #ndrsgpic.twitter.com/ffXRMkEILy"

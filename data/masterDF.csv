For reference, he's a relatively young (late 20s) black man who grew up in the hood &amp; circumstance led him to the archetypal thug life-- selling drugs, petty larceny, B&amp;E, ultimately he ended up charged as a repeat felon, so who knows if/when I'll see him again, but he was always a very friendly &amp; generous guy towards me despite such shit conditions, &amp; it's upsetting to see things turn out this way. I'd periodically stop hearing from him and then get a text out of the blue, so it was probably a year before I even found out he was incarcerated (and was going to be for a whole lot longer than the last times).   


I didn't actually know his full real name until recently because he always went by a nickname, but a week ago I found it out &amp; realized I could send him mail, including books. I've heard about more than one person in similar circumstances for whom being exposed to radical thought in prison really changed their lives and gave them new hope &amp; purpose; specifically the works of black liberation activists who wrote about prison &amp; the links between racism, classism, etc. in our legal, political, &amp; economic system, and how these things could be changed (Angela Davis, for example, &amp; many of the prominent Black Panthers of the 1960s).  


My reading on prisons (and of people who wrote from within prison) is pretty limited though, &amp; while I have a lot of respect for these thinkers &amp; revolutionaries and like what I have read of them, I don't have enough frame of reference in that area to know what would be especially good options. So what do you think would be good introductory texts for someone in his position? What would speak to him &amp; provide some kind of emotional support to help him get through his bid? I don't want it to be overly academic, because I don't think that'd interest him much, but something impactful. It doesn't have to be Angela Davis or Bobby Seale or someone (that might be a bit stereotypical &amp; might not be obviously relevant to someone my age who isn't already very political, though I'm open to any suggestions), and it could be someone more contemporary who I may not know about (like I said, I haven't kept up with prison lit), and it doesn't even have to be about prisons (hell, maybe Maya Angelou or something more creative like that would help him get by), but ideally someone who writes relatably... And probably not writing about outright prison abolition (that is a tough pill to swallow for most non-lefties, and even a lot of lefties).  


Any other book gift ideas would be welcome, but I thought something like this seemed like a good idea that maybe he'd appreciate. I'll be writing him a letter soon, but I know if I were in prison I'd be desperate for something to read to pass the time. Plus, it sounds like books are one of the few things you can actually mail prisoners (at least in my area).

socialism,Other Victims of the Holocaust A Fair Point or Subtle Holocaust Revisionism,"This is very long, but I hope you read it. This subject is very important to me, and it should be to all socialists too. 

I am a historian that specializes in threatened ethnicities and religious populations, particularly victims of genocide, so I know a fair amount about the Holocaust, though it is not my only area of study. After today, after the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I feel compelled to offer some points to a discussion I see frequently.  

I believe speaking about it on this sub is importantly because I am a socialist, and I approach this as a socialist, and I want to hear the input of people who also approach history with this understanding of history. 

*Now to my point:* I frequently see complaints about more popular portrayals of the holocaust, particularly, that the media over emphasizes the genocide of European Jews, at the neglect of the estimated five million other civilian victims of the Nazis. 

This complaints brings up serious concerns that need to be understood and discussed, but too frequently I see people make conclusions based on these observations that are not historically accurate, and frankly, appear antisemitic. 

Mostly, I have seen argued that Jews get more ""attention"" in the media, and that is why the Jews are focused on in Holocaust history. Implied here: the Jews are controlling the narrative of the Holocaust because the Jews are controlling the media. This is, of course, a centuries old antisemitic trope that I hope I don't need to refute for anyone here. 

However, it is a fact that most of the narrative surrounding the Holocaust is about the estimated six million Jews murdered by the nazis, even though there were literally millions of non-Jewish civilian victims targeted and murdered too. 

So why is this, really? I will argue there are two reasons. 

First, the Jews were the primary target of Nazi propaganda. The demon and scapegoat of all ills in Nazi Germany, and for much of the rest of Europe too, was the Jews. The Nazis blamed every societal Ill (or percieved ill) on the Jews, and that includes the ""ills"" that made many of the non-Jewish groups a target of the Nazis. 

Nazis gave everything they hated the label of ""Jew,"" or claimed they were the result if Jewish influence and monopoly. They called science they didnt like ""Jüdische Physik."" They designated a category of ""degenerate art"" (Entartete Kunst), and claimed it was the result of Jewish influence.  Jews were blamed for the loss of the Great War, and for depression during the Weimar era. To our interest especially as socialists, Jews were blamed for both the ills of capitalism, particularly that Jews monopolized the banking and commerce industries, but also Jews were strongly blamed for the ""ills"" of communism.  

Goebbels said ""Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.""

The Holocaust was very much *about* the Jews, even though they were not the only targets and victims of the Nazis. 

This brings me to point two, which is that political dissidents, particularly communists, were a major target of persecution, murder, and genocide by the Nazis, and the Holocaust was, in some ways, *about* the decay of capitalism into fascism, and its inevitable strong backlash to communism. So why are the political, particularly communist victims of the Nazis not openly talked about in popular depictions of the Holocaust? First I will say I think it has to do with my first point. The Jews were the scapegoat of Nazi Germany and much of European history. The Holocaust was just the most recent and most extreme example of a murderous trend that largely focused on Jews. The Holocaust was a continuation of a very long line of Jewish persecution, so to remove the importance and centrality of the Jewish aspects of the Holocaust is to dismiss the centuries of precident and buildup up to this act of genocide. It is possible that the Holocaust, including all its non-Jewish victims, would not have happened without those previous centuries of persecution and precedent.  

However, I cannot ignore that there is an element of Western propaganda in the portrayal of the Holocaust being *about* the Jews, to the neglect of its other victims. And I primarily suspect that because by adopting this Nazi blanket term for ""Jew"" for all the victims of the holocaust, the West can cleanly and easily not talk about how the Nazis very explicitly targeted communists. Communists are never to be seen as victims, rather they are always the perpetrators of crimes. Communists and Nazis are one thing, in Western propaganda. 

Do not forget the Nazis blamed the burning of the Reichstag on the communists. 

Do not forget that Dachau was opened first as a camp for political dissidents. The president of the Munich police said in 1933 ""Here [Dachau] Communists, 'Marxists' and Reichsbanner leaders who endangered the security of the State would be kept in custody."" (Source at end). 

So what does the popular media have to gain about the narrative of the Holocaust being about the Jews? We can all agree, it's not to appease a one world Jewish agenda. We can possibly agree it is because Nazi propaganda centralized the Jews as the root of all ""problems,"" and the precident of anti Jewish violence in Europe played a part in the advent of the Holocaust. But is that all? 

I believe we as communists and socialists need to really understand this issue. The representation of history is as telling as history itself.

How comes it turned out this way? Is it the American dream an extremely potent brainwashing drug? Is it the CIA, while being incompetence at fighting abroad, is really good at killing labour figures like Fred Hampton? Or, is it that several generations were shielded from the negative consequences of their actions, be it cracking down on the unions to opening the way to neoliberalism, because of the ill-gotten wealth their much more smarter ancestors had accrued?

The American people must have had become lethargic. How come haven’t they refuse all of these misery? How the hell could the “Who is going to pay for it” rhetoric work so well?

socialism,Cashiers and the labour aristocracy I was reading a comment on a post about the labour aristocracy and it said that cashiers were paid more than the value they produced while the third world worker which assembled said commodity was paid an amount far below the value produced I agree about the third world worker but I have a few questions about the first statement 1 How much value do you guys think a cashier actually produces to me it appears to be such a small amount that its almost non existent 2 Why should the capitalist pay the worker more than the value he produced It appears to me that underpaying him relative to value produced is in his interest wouldnt it be paying him more than the value of his labour power This would seem to me at least much more rational and realistic Maybe they are saying that the value of the labour power is higher than the value produced and that this initially negative contract is only sustainable as it is necessary through the super exploitation and creation of super profits at another end of the process line 3If this is the problem how would it be solved under socialism Doesnt seem to me like there is any real solution if the value of the labour power is higher than the value created by the labour 4 Why specifically a cashier Maybe because the value of the labour power outweighs the value produced  Because even if we take this case as true this principle does not expand to the rest of the working majority just look at the average amount earned by a worker and a CEO its 287x you cant be telling me that CEOs produce 287 more value than the average  worker There also clearly exists extraction of surplus in the imperialist core even though the severity of this exploitation cannot even start to be compared with that of the one in the third worldPs I know some people dont like the term third world but for simplicitys sake I used it Im sorry if I offended anyone,"I was reading a comment on a post about the labour aristocracy, and it said that cashiers were paid more than the value they produced, while the third world worker which assembled said commodity was paid an amount far below the value produced. 

I agree about the third world worker, but I have a few questions about the first statement 
1. How much value do you guys think a cashier actually produces? to me it appears to be such a small amount, that it's almost non existent 
2. Why should the capitalist pay the worker more than the value he produced? It appears to me that underpaying him relative to value produced, is in his interest: wouldn't it be paying him more than the value of his labour power? This would seem to me at least, much more rational and realistic. Maybe they are saying that the value of the labour power is higher than the value produced, and that this initially negative contract is only sustainable, as it is necessary, through the super exploitation and creation of super profits at another end of the process line. 
3.If this is the problem, how would it be solved under socialism? Doesn't seem to me like there is any real solution if the value of the labour power is higher than the value created by the labour 
4. Why specifically a cashier? (Maybe because the value of the labour power outweighs the value produced?)  Because even if we take this case as true, this principle does not expand to the rest of the working majority, just look at the average amount earned by a worker, and a CEO (it's 287x, you can't be telling me that CEOs produce 287 more value than the average  worker). There also clearly exists extraction of surplus in the imperialist core, even though the severity of this exploitation cannot even start to be compared with that of the one in the third world.

Ps: I know some people don't like the term ""third world"", but for simplicity's sake, I used it. I'm sorry if I offended anyone.",,,

The militia movement and patriot movement are virtually one in the same. They claim to believe in the constitution and freedom yet at the same time decree the government as a tyrannical force and anti-American. The fact is, there is literally nothing more American than the government. What the militia movement means is that they are against any government that does not suit their specific brand right-wing terror and stripping those who they deem undesirable of any democratic rights. 
They have strong ties to white supremeacist movements but do not take many political positions openly. 

Fascism in America has never looked like the fascism of the European variety because fascism is inherently patriotic. America is a brand in and of itself built around it’s own mythology justifying the subjugation and exploitation of oppressed nations peoples as well as its own white working class.

The fact is that to be an American patriot is to uphold the abuse, murder, and exploitation of working people everywhere - on American soil and abroad. America is a killing machine and this aspect is what appeals most to the patriot/militia movement. They want to consolidate power through their politicians and enforce their power through violence. Just look at how these militia groups have been kidnapping immigrants crossing the border and turning them over to border patrol after sexually abusing and torturing them. They received no punitive measures when they turned these people over. 

These movements are growing far and wide but are strongest in the northwest where they occupy many towns and have base camps that are funded by elected officials like Matt shay (an open antisemite who wrote a manifesto of declaring biblical war on the rest of the country and was elected for 6 terms and is still in office and has a close relationship with Donald trump).

The oath keepers one group apart of these extrajudicial armed political groups and they are made up of police officers and military men. I’m fact, you cannot join if you do not have official ties to either of these institutions. They have operate as mercenaries for reaction. And the Southern Poverty Law Center  list the oath keepers and the 3%ers and white supremeacist.

When they say they are not white supremacist, this is tongue and cheek. They do have some members who are not white but they idealize and fetishize and specifically American ideals and history that exclusively served white wealthy or landowning people and the most backward elements of non-whites and their aim to drag all of American society back into a fantasy that never really existed, ignoring the fact that many white immigrants were not land-owning and in some cases were treated only slightly better than slaves like in the case of the Irish upon entering into the United States. 

So when taking all of this into account, what can we say about the 20,000+ militia men who marched in Richmond Virginia on Martin Luther King day about a bill that had been making the legal rounds for awhile. Why choose MLK day? How could so many people attend? Your answers can be found in the above paragraphs. But what I cannot answer is what you’re going to do about it.

It’s important to study these movements and encourage family and friends to engage with these politics. Sure it’s sometimes uncomfortable to talk politics with people we care for but it’s much better to have an uncomfortable conversation now and organize steel our friends and family against sympathizing or excusing these groups than allowing these militias to gain power for the sake of temporary interpersonal peace.

I hope you all have the time to look into and verify my statements. I apologize for my lack of links. I’m really bad at that kind of stuff.

socialism,A South African collective wants to open an infoshop and needs your support,"Hi everyone! I’m boloparts, an anarchist based in South Africa and member of Repairs and Parts - a pop-up radical infoshop collective based in Cape Town that plans on creating an alternative social space beginning in March 2020 for three months. It will be the only one of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa at least, so far as we know. We could really use international solidarity, help, and reparations, (also, the dollar and the euro go far here!) but to start:

**ABOUT US**: We are working to build a queer, black conscious, intersectional feminist, anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist counter-culture. We reject hierarchy, instead working to build self-managed, self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions. We are committed to challenging society by asking critical questions of ourselves and others to nurture new social values and new forms of collective organizing, which will become the socio-political infrastructure of the free society. We hope to create a community space for workshops, live performance, film, art and education emerging from a politics of collective liberation.

**OUR CAPACITIES**: Our collective is really great, all intersectional anticapitalists, and has a diverse set of skills, including people who have done all kinds of organising over many years, and have run infoshops before. We already have enough members that we would be able to fill a morning, afternoon, and evening shift, 6 days a week. We do not yet have a location, and this is currently our biggest hurdle, but we have enough time and capacity that we should be able to find one. Aside from that, what we need from you is material support, for rent and and other set-up costs.

**OUR RESOURCES**: We are fortunate that one overseas anarchist group has already offered us 700US$ per month towards our rent, which significantly reduces our burden. We suspect our rent to be anywhere between 700 and 1100 US$. Other US and Asian radical individuals and groups have donated books as well as money, and we have some substantial amount of our own.

**TO HELP**: You can send us money to this [PayPal](http://paypal.me/carbonatedart), and please share this information. This appeal is already quite long so I will wind it down. I am happy to try to answer what questions I can if you would like to ask them. Please like and share us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/repairsandparts/) to learn more about us and about anti-authoritarian thought and praxis in our context. We should be posting more regularly there soon.

Thank you to the people behind this sub for allowing this post.

\[One final note to do right by you all: Just to say that though we’re going to do our best to make this a reality, and as you can see it is quite likely, we can’t guarantee it. If the project does not get off the ground, we are committed to using whatever donations towards projects in the same ethic.\]",,,

The workers met in democratic councils to make decisions about production. They could even vote themselves pay raises and mark up prices to rip off consumers if they wanted to. It must be noted that, although it wasn't as great a disaster as most centrally planned economies, Yugoslavian socialism suffered from chronic problems with inflation, unemployment and a balance of payments deficit. 

In one Q&amp;A post, Prof. Wolff does acknowledge the experiment in Yugoslavia, but argues that government interference from above was the main problem with it. Many economists disagree with this assessment and in fact claim that the exact opposite is the case. Yugoslavia had initially combined market socialism with elements of central planning by regulating investment through 5 year plans. But it was when the government began deregulating enterprises and decentralizing investment decision making that an element of deep volatility was introduced and Yugoslavia plunged into economic chaos, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the nation itself.",,,

The entire system is so incredibly broken to the point that even if we get a left-wing president in power, any source of meaningful legislation would just be blocked by the reactionaries in the government.

socialism,Collected brief quotes on Capitalism excerpts with links to full text," ""I know full well that under these conditions that if I were a capitalist, who needs a hundred workers to fertilize my capital, that on employing these workers, all the advantages are for me, all the disadvantages for them. I propose nothing more nor less than to exploit them, and if you wish me to be sincere about it, and promise to guard me well, I will tell them:

""Look, my children, I have some capital which by itself cannot produce anything, because a dead thing cannot produce anything. I have nothing productive without labor. As it goes, I cannot benefit from consuming it unproductively, since having consumed it, I would be left with nothing. But thanks to the social and political institutions which rule over us and are all in my favor, in the existing economy my capital is supposed to be a producer as well: it earns me interest. From whom this interest must be taken - and it must be from someone, since in reality by itself it produces absolutely nothing - this does not concern you. It is enough for you to know that it renders interest. Alone this interest is insufficient to cover my expenses. I am not an ordinary man as you. I cannot be, nor do I want to be, content with little. I want to live, to inhabit a beautiful house, to eat and drink well, to ride in a carriage, to maintain a good appearance, in short, to have all the good things in life. I also want to give a good education to my children, to make them into gentlemen, and send them away to study, and afterwards, having become much more educated than you, they can dominate you one day as I dominate you today. And as education alone is not enough, I want to give them a grand inheritance, so that divided between them they will be left almost as rich as I. Consequently, besides all the good things in life I want to give myself, I also want to increase my capital. How will I achieve this goal? Armed with this capital I propose to exploit you, and I propose that you permit me to exploit you. You will work and I will collect and appropriate and sell for my own behalf the product of your labor, without giving you more than a portion which is absolutely necessary to keep you from dying of hunger today, so that at the end of tomorrow you will still work for me in the same conditions; and when you have been exhausted, I will throw you out, and replace you with others. Know it well, I will pay you a salary as small, and impose on you a working day as long, working conditions as severe, as despotic, as harsh as possible; not from wickedness - not from a motive of hatred towards you, nor an intent to do you harm - but from the love of wealth and to get rich quick; because the less I pay you and the more you work, the more I will gain.""

This is what is said implicitly by every capitalist, every industrialist, every business owner, every employer who demands the labor power of the workers they hire.""

socialism,Women Part of Wealth Accumulation,"This unpaid work by the working women, in kitchen or otherwise, helps their men to get freedom from the house work and give extra time to their ""labor power"" purchasers (The capitalist class). The value of this labor power does not increase due increase in labor time, as the need to reproduce the labor power (The laborer or the worker) does not increase, as he does not have to cook or mend!

Thus the home makers or house wives work gives extra working time to the capitalist class free of wages, as extra profit! Thus the real emancipation of working women is related to the emancipation of the working class, as a whole, and to the proletarian revolution!

socialism,Some random questions about Socialism Capitalism and Communism that youve probably already had to answer a dozen times today,"First post on this sub. I reflexively agree with collectivist based economies that (1) dignify the people, (2) makes sure that they have enough of the fundamentals in life, including healthcare, a social life, art, etc. and (3) doesn't create inequality. That being said, I'm posting my questions as a friend of you. 

* Are Cap', Soc', and Com' a linear progression of economic distribution? If it is, I'm sure that we can clearly classify at what state an economy is based on some metrics. 

* Socialism and Communism always seems to be spoken about together, but never Socialism and Capitalism. I thought that socialism was ""the third way"" and in between capitalism and communism, however, socialism is spoken with communism and never capitalism for some reason. 

* Capitalists take credit for China's rise starting in '78, India's rise, which started in '91, and S. Korea's rise, which started in '50. These are all dramatic increases in the standards of living of 3 peoples. What kind of successes can Socialism claim? 

* Not sure if this question belongs here: But why did a socialist government - the Nazis - distrust and hate the communists of Germany so much? [Is it because the German Communist Party had a lot of followers, and they were simply viewed as being the most worthy competitors?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany) I'm confused about the Nazi's grievances towards communists. Maybe they abstracted their hatred of the Soviets to their economic ideology as well.",,,

I'm a Swedish teenage leftie who's very much into like lefty social politics, into acab, and into the general gist of leftist economics and such. It's just that I don't really understand how it would all work. 

I'm all against neoliberalism and I do realise that a system that needs indefinite growth as if resources were infinite is super bad for the planet, the workers, and everything like that, but I don't understand how socialism would really work in practice. All I've gotten to hear when debating people close to me is that nobody would be motivated to work, and that, if things were just made for consumption and not profit, wouldn't that discourage a lot of workers from working harder? Wouldn't that also keep companies from growing if profits just weren't a thing? And how would larger products function if there wasn't any boss, with like hundreds of workers working in a coordinated fashion on one product? Who'd decide what products would be made?

 It feels like a lot of the left I know of really likes critiquing capitalism, which I'm all for, because fuck capitalism, but what am I supposed to say when someone asks what we should have instead? People just bring up the points above each time I claim to be against capitalism, and I'm sure I've missed some of them.

I'm all for being educated on all of this because I am sure that I am wrong in what I've gotten to hear from my peers, it's just that I'm not sure in which ways, or what is correct.",,,

socialism,An interesting concept So I come to my concept which is  what would happen if you would give all people food water shelter electricity healthcare etc for free Lets say that those jobs which would create such are 50  of all work that is done If that is the case then think about a security guard and a farmer whom would own two coins each and the security guard would say to the farmer Hey man I give you my two coins and then you can have all the coins if you give me food for free well what it would do If they would have 2500  a month of salary then the farmer would have 5000  a month because you can circulate wealth without doing work by dividing the pot which is the wealth of the world to all the workers whom uphold the society and then everything could be freeOf course also if the farmer wouldnt want to work as much then heshe could give an opportunity to another person and then we would have a society which would function upon those whom uphold the society and those whom would be unemployed could get something like 100  a month which would mean if my calculations are correct 84 trillion euros meaning the whole seven billion people and then those whom work could share the livelihood of 916 trillion euros and the benefit also would be that some countries might not afford the universal basic income even to the level of having basic needs for all people and in this scenario developed countries wouldnt even give wealth to Africa etc but basically food and then the money would stay in the developed countriesBut I think that my concept is a bit too much for people and it needs quite a lot of calculations and therefore I would assume that world just goes with economic growth and if it isnt possible and there would happen a global depression then people should use capital levy which is that not only income is taxed but also wealth I think that if there was food and water for all and the society would collapse to a depression then by taking wealth from the elite there would be food and water for all but I like my concept because that would create discussion in this world and perhaps then people would listen to some of the economists speaking about different models of the society Possibly many would argue against my model but in 1970s mankind was in balance with nature and therefore the tasks which people would have to take could be quite big Ive copypasted from a book that Ill never write because Im too awful writer and I hope this subreddit accepts socialist capitalism,"”So, I come to my concept which is - what would happen if you would give all people food, water, shelter, electricity, healthcare, etc. for free? Let's say that those jobs which would create such are 50 % of all work that is done. If that is the case then think about a security guard and a farmer whom would own two coins each and the security guard would say to the farmer: ""Hey man! I give you my two coins and then you can have all the coins if you give me food for free!"", well what it would do? If they would have 2500 € a month of salary then the farmer would have 5000 € a month because you can circulate wealth without doing work by dividing the pot which is the wealth of the world to all the workers whom uphold the society and then everything could be free.

Of course also if the farmer wouldn't want to work as much then he/she could give an opportunity to another person and then we would have a society which would function upon those whom uphold the society, and those whom would be unemployed could get something like 100 € a month which would mean if my calculations are correct 8,4 trillion euros, meaning the whole seven billion people and then those whom work could share the livelihood of 91,6 trillion euros, and the benefit also would be that some countries might not afford the universal basic income even to the level of having basic needs for all people and in this scenario developed countries wouldn't even give wealth to Africa, etc., but basically food and then the money would stay in the developed countries.

But I think that my concept is a bit too much for people, and it needs quite a lot of calculations and therefore I would assume that world just goes with economic growth and if it isn't possible and there would happen a global depression then people should use capital levy which is that not only income is taxed, but also wealth. I think that if there was food and water for all and the society would collapse to a depression then by taking wealth from the ""elite"" there would be food and water for all, but I like my concept because that would create discussion in this world and perhaps then people would listen to some of the economists speaking about different models of the society. Possibly many would argue against my model, but in 1970's mankind was in balance with nature and therefore the tasks which people would have to take could be quite big.”

socialism,No its not just the top 1 percent who are part of the the problem the top 10 are too let me explain why,"TL;DR: People are suffering and it'll just get worse if we continue on this path. Especially the privileged top 10% who are highly educated should do more so disadvantaged people can have a better live instead of gate keeping and engaging in nepotistic behavior. We all can and should do something to make this world a better place.

I'm sure most people here are familiar with the concept of the upper class, ultra-rich, billionaire class or whatever you want to call them, these people are generally viewed as the main beneficiaries of the capitalistic system which is in place today.

But, while it is true that their gains vastly outsize the rest of the population, I would argue that there's another class that has also been doing quite well under capitalism, the upper middle class, the top 10% percent.

The majority of these people are highly-educated professionals like lawyers, doctors, consultants, engineers, programmers and so on. Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being highly educated after all education is a human right and everyone has a fair chance to receive it and people who can't make it simply don't have the smarts for it, right?

Well, sadly, maybe in the minds of neoliberals that is the reality,  but the ACTUAL REALITY is devastatingly different from this kind of dreamworld thinking. The vast MAJORITY of the 10% percent comes from an EXCEPTIONALLY PRIVILEGED background, especially in the U.S. where [social mobility is very poor](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/02/14/americans-overestimate-social-mobility-in-their-country) and in stark contrast to the fairy tail of the ""American Dream"". To put that in perspective, [Harvard’s Class of 2022 is made up of over 36% legacy students](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/07/harvards-freshman-class-is-more-than-one-third-legacy.html), this is nothing expect straight up NEPOTISM in the 21st century hid under the guise of the so called [""meritocracy"" (article from The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/19/the-myth-of-meritocracy-who-really-gets-what-they-deserve).

And that's just the tip of the iceberg, dozens of elite prep schools visited mostly by the 10% and the 1% present an Hi DISPROPORTIONATE at the top schools. For example, Trinity School which is located in the very posh Upper West Side of Manhattan [sends over 40% of its graduates to only the Ivy League alone](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-us-private-schools-with-the-most-graduates-getting-into-ivy-league-universities-13325695). Many upper-class citizens would likely dismiss this sick nepotism with saying ""But look, we're accepting so many poor people, so we're actually the ones who're at the disadvantage here! THAT IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH.

1. The privileged kids will be accepted, even with rather mediocre grades. Why? MONEY. DONATIONS. LEGACY. NEPOTISM.
2. But what about the poor kids that don't have perfect grades? No chance at all.
3. What about the kids whose parents can't afford to live in these classy neighborhoods? Just gonna have to attend that local school, where no one goes to the Ivy League, to whom no so-called ""philanthropist"" has ever donated or will ever donate millions, where the parents are cashiers making 40k or are straight up unemployed. A way larger percentage of children fits the second and third point than 10% percent, I assure you, no matter if they live in rural West Virginia or in the devastated former industrial cities of the Rust Belt.

The world needs desegregated quality public education, not nepotism for the elite and their offspring. Every institution of learning should be open to everyone and free for everyone!

A sizeable portion of the upper middle class and rich make fun of those people and finance propaganda against them, many of them are (neo)liberal too, calling them ""lazy"" while they live from their inheritance, their only job being a ""philanthropist"", so to say trading money for awards, calling them ""unintelligent"" while they are so egoistic that they can't even comprehend that they would be in the same situation would it not be for their birth privilege, they call them ""irresponsible"" while they refuse too pay any taxes because they feel they deserve/know better.

They say the poor ""demand/complain too much"" while they, the top 10% percent live extremely privileged lives, especially on reddit this kind of entitlement gets absolutely fucking ridiculous

A common narrative here on reddit is ""We're making 250k in SF but it's too expensive"" EXTREME ENTITLEMENT. These people often live quite lavishly eating out every week and maybe also leasing a car like a Tesla and renting a fancy condo. The median income in SF is 100k, imagine how people that make 50k and aren't part of the upper middle-class bubble have to fucking  live.

Another example, an above average percentage of doctors/lawyers etc. is in favor of neoliberal policies. I guess it's nothing surprising since their parents and they themselves are very likely part of the 10% percent and so are benefiting from the capitalist system. In r/medicine they complain about expensive student loans, which probably isn't an issue for chunk of them since their parents are quite well-off while. Although in reality there are surely people who are in for the money, because when that profession pays so ""badly"", then why do many of them live the high live? Driving Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Porsche, Jaguar, living in million dollar homes and having lavish vacations seems nothing to complain about, but I guess when your neighbors are hedge fund managers with a few private jets, luxury yachts and super cars it's ""poorly paid"", they act like they live in a different reality and they probably do. But if you daresay that [they are overpaid](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557) they will suggest that they should be paid even more, but to be fair, most people would probably say that too.

But unsurprisingly they're still in favor of neoliberal politicians which scold poor people and bestow honor unto every rich person, no matter they and their families made money from exploiting peasants, letting slaves work themselves to death, from forced labor and so on. There is also a disproportionate of the top 10% who are descendants of nobility and other ""exploiters"" like robber barons and so on. They're especially overrepresented at highly ranked universities and research institutions, if you look for them you will have no problem finding them. Their academic career today is made possible by past exploitation and suffering of the lower classes. It is also notable that the 10% percent are also the feeder class for the 0,1%, Zuckbot's parents? Both doctors. Gates parents? Lawyer and executive. Bezos parents? Engineer and Academic. They are successful because their PRIVILEGE is GIGANTIC!

But the thing is that these people are simply humans, and the problem lies exactly here, they aren't treated as such by our capitalistic society, they're TREATED and WORSHIPED as GODS. There are no gods, only humans. I believe that humans are corruptible, error prone, egoistic and narcissistic. No one is exempt from this. The power must be distributed equally. I'd argue this and the lack of development and progress led to the demise of communism in the 20st century and I think this is the case in Venezuela too.

No human deserves to wield all this [extreme privilege](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/ivanka-trump-ces-technology-las-vegas) and power and that's why I like socialism. To create a society in which me don't have rich and poor, but through redistribution and education instead create a giant middle class and bring everyone together, with a better live for everyone. That truly would be utopia, not some nonsensical neoliberal dream by a 13 or 48 year old like let's take RICH people to the MARS while the POOR are fucking STARVING. FIX THE REAL PROBLEMS!",,,

It simultaneously drags itself closer to international economic disaster - the likes of which will make the 2008 recession look like a hiccup.

No wonder the Victims of Communism Foundation just fearfully published a global survey that revealed most people think capitalism ""does more harm than good.""

Studying marxism and learning about all the different movements from CNT-FAI to the Cubans has been fascinating. I'm a freshman in college studying mechanical engineering and helped create my college's Young Democratic Socialists of America. For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by military life. It would be my dream to join a left-wing militia in the US, but sadly they have all but been destroyed. I figured the next best thing is to join the military to learn combat skills. Additionally, I would then have the opportunity to get a Ph.D. and the military would pay for it. Even though I want to radically destroy and rebuild our country's institutions, I still love this country, not the US per se, but rather everyone in it. My great-grandparents fought the nazis in the military and I want to do my part to protect the people of the world. Thus I figured joining the military is better than working for some damn bourgeois company, at least in the military I could learn to prepare myself and comrades to fight for the people if a revolution/civil war occurs.

Most of them are related to stereotypes.

1. Do you have feelings? Do you live in today's society just wishing things would get better? Do you think you are worthy of love, friendship, affection?

2. Why while exercising your right of free speech, you're so annoying? Protesting on the Capitol, making noise, and on social media, you can't go against your opinion - because you attack the person who doesn't have the same opinion.

3. There is a notion that leftism is extremely bothersome and a lot of people outright segregate leftists. How do you feel about it?

4. Why most leftists seem to have serious mental issues, or personal problems, that lead to activis

I sincerely want to understand ""the other side"" of things. I feel a pain on hating people for their opinions... But I want to know why that opinion is formed. 

I'm convinced there is an effort to dehumanize leftism in all its forms... I'm trying to go backwards and humanize those that seem to be a threat.

socialism,In a sense you could say were involved in the class struggle  Martin Luther King Jr,"Although MLK will be remembered for his work during the civil rights movement, and everything he did for African Americans, many forget his message of class struggle and his fight against capitalism. People praise MLK for his amazing work but fail to implement them into their lives. He did not just fight so people stopped killing black people, or to end segregation, or to legalise interracial marriages. It was more than that. His fight was against capitalism, imperialism and institutional racism, all which is prevalent today.

If MLK was spreading his message today, he would have been shot down by the likes of Fox news, The Sun, Daily Mail and the rest of the mainstream media. His views are very closely connected to socialism. He constantly spoke out against and attacked capitalism, even as far as saying “today capitalism has out-lived its usefulness.” Neoliberals should examine his words closely and understand that MLK would not have been their ally. Their ideology is not compatible with his. He believed in empowering the poor and working class. He wanted to free all of us from the chains that are wrapped around our necks under this capitalistic society. In his fight for economic justice, he wanted a radical redistribution of economy and political power. MLK part of the class struggle.

socialism,Socialism technology and YOU There are two models of the web The current model is where data is centralized where corporations own that data and can resell it and can build surveillance systems The alternative model is one where data money speech and power is decentralizedMany socialists try to warn and resist the current approach without embracing the alternative approach Every single time you use google email facebook or any other centralized service you are reinforcing the power of the centralized modelTo embrace the decentralized model you need to educate yourself on decentralized technologies and decentralized ways of moving money storing value talking to others storing production data and storingcreating informationMany of the following resources were born out of cryptocurrency This does NOT mean that they are strictly stores of value although some of them can function as mediums of exchange To be a modern socialist technoanarchist you need to learn the following technologies They are what I would consider to be socialist technologies just like social science and voting strategies are social technologies1 Ethereum Ethereum is a world computer that runs mini programs known as smart contracts Think of it as having the computation power of a wristwatch but the data access and reach of a very large database The nice thing about ethereum is that the smart contracts are visible to all and immutable Ethereum has a native currency in the system known as Ether Ether is used to pay people who run the smart contracts for their machine compute time and their electricity It can also be used as a store of value or a medium of exchange or purely for speculation However for our purposes what we are interested in is smart contracts because smart contracts allow for the creation of corporations that have no shareholders no ceos and no management This allows for workers to wholly own the means of production in their entirety without a method for a capitalist to buy the rights to the means of production at any time in the future2 Steem This is an alternative platform to reddit and facebook People are paid to post although unless your quite popular you wont make much at all The nice thing about steem is that content is hosted on the blockchain This means that it is immutable The important thing for socialists here is that in social bloggernetwork worlds the means of production and the rewards of those means of production are often detached In addition corporations can censor those they dislike Steem addresses both of these issues by paying the users and making it impossible to censor articles3 Iota Iota is a weird one and it is something you want to get into for one of four reasons Either your an investorspeculator who just wants to buy tokens you make electronics you manage lots of public data or your a math nerd and love trinary programming Iota is all about storing data and keeping a very high number of transactions in sync with each other The iota technology stack was built originally as a platform for Qubic quorum based computation and has evolved since then The iota API allows you to instantly and frictionlessly move tokens as a transaction anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world within a few seconds However transactions dont need to have money in them they can have data As a result an entire architecture has been built around tracking parts components and pieces of data The important thing about iota though for us socialists is a storage technique known as MaM masked authenticated messaging MaM allows the user to give and revoke access to a continuous data stream This allows users to own their own data and to revoke the access to their data at an API level to any other entity This is important to ensure that data siloing like what google and facebook does does not occur Data siloing is the precursor to social surveillance systems4 Bitcoin At this point everyone knows what it is Buy some Learn how it works Play with it Bitcoin allows the people to store their money out of reach of the government and when a capitalist government collapses they like to steal from the citizens Case in point Greece Greece was loaned a bunch of money by capitalist speculators in the years leading up to 2016 They couldnt pay they were forced by the investors to take austerity measures cut social programs and then as a final indignity they gave all public greek account holders a haircut The equivalent of over 3000 usd was withdrawn from the accounts of every single person in the country overnight Of course some accounts didnt have that much and they were simply zeroed out This hit the poor people and the every day workers the hardest The only workers who

on chrome firefox or brave,"There are two models of the web. The current model is where data is centralized, where corporations own that data, and can resell it, and can build surveillance systems. The alternative model is one where data, money, speech, and power is decentralized.

Many socialists try to warn and resist the current approach, without embracing the alternative approach. Every single time you use google email, facebook, or any other centralized service, you are reinforcing the power of the centralized model.

To embrace the decentralized model, you need to educate yourself on decentralized technologies and decentralized ways of moving money, storing value, talking to others, storing production data, and storing/creating information.

Many of the following resources were born out of cryptocurrency. This does NOT mean that they are strictly stores of value, although some of them can function as mediums of exchange. To be a modern socialist/ technoanarchist you need to learn the following technologies. They are what I would consider to be socialist technologies, just like social science and voting strategies are social technologies.

1. Ethereum. Ethereum is a world computer that runs mini programs known as smart contracts. Think of it as having the computation power of a wristwatch, but the data access and reach of a very large database. The nice thing about ethereum is that the smart contracts are visible to all and immutable. Ethereum has a native currency in the system, known as Ether. Ether is used to pay people who run the smart contracts for their machine compute time and their electricity. It can also be used as a store of value or a medium of exchange, or purely for speculation. However, for our purposes, what we are interested in is smart contracts, because smart contracts allow for the creation of corporations that have no shareholders, no ceos, and no management. This allows for workers to wholly own the means of production in their entirety, without a method for a capitalist to buy the rights to the means of production at any time in the future.
2. Steem. This is an alternative platform to reddit and facebook. People are paid to post (although unless your quite popular, you won't make much at all). The nice thing about steem is that content is hosted on the blockchain. This means that it is immutable. The important thing for socialists here is that in social blogger/network worlds the means of production and the rewards of those means of production are often detached. In addition, corporations can censor those they dislike. Steem addresses both of these issues by paying the users, and making it impossible to censor articles.
3. Iota. Iota is a weird one, and it is something you want to get into for one of four reasons. Either your an investor/speculator who just wants to buy tokens, you make electronics, you manage lots of public data, or your a math nerd and love trinary programming. Iota is all about storing data and keeping a very high number of transactions in sync with each other. The iota technology stack was built originally as a platform for Qubic (quorum based computation) and has evolved since then. The iota API allows you to instantly and frictionlessly move tokens as a transaction anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world within a few seconds. However, transactions don't need to have money in them, they can have data. As a result, an entire architecture has been built around tracking parts, components, and pieces of data. The important thing about iota though for us socialists is a storage technique known as MaM (masked authenticated messaging). MaM allows the user to give and revoke access to a continuous data stream. This allows users to own their own data and to revoke the access to their data at an API level to any other entity. This is important to ensure that data siloing (like what google and facebook does) does not occur. Data siloing is the precursor to social surveillance systems.
4. Bitcoin. At this point, everyone knows what it is. Buy some. Learn how it works. Play with it. Bitcoin allows the people to store their money out of reach of the government, and when a capitalist government collapses, they like to steal from the citizens. Case in point, Greece. Greece was loaned a bunch of money by capitalist speculators in the years leading up to 2016. They couldn't pay, they were forced by the investors to take austerity measures, cut social programs, and then as a final indignity, they gave all public greek account holders a haircut. The equivalent of over $3000 usd was withdrawn from the accounts of every single person in the country overnight. Of course, some accounts didn't have that much, and they were simply zeroed out. This hit the poor people and the every day workers the hardest. The only workers who had any money after this event were those who held assets that the banks could not touch. At the time, bitcoin was pretty much the only asset that was well known, commonly used, and held a comparatively large amount of value. Make no mistake, when the capitalists suffer extreme losses, you will feel the backlash if your heavily invested in the banking system.
5. Sci-Hub. This is a niche website that runs on conventional centralized models of the internet. However, it is so well defended and obfuscated (as well as being run out of Kazakhstan) that I might as well throw it in as a resource. Sci-Hub focuses on making Scientific journals public and open source. They directly steal from capitalist gatekeepers who paywall knowledge such as Elsevier, and allow the people to have access to these articles for free. This might not assist the everyday comrade, but if you are trying to make insulin, or you are doing anything in the genetic engineering field, this is right up your alley.
6. TOR. The onion router is a browser that allows anonymity. Download it today, use it, learn it, and understand what it does.
7. Brave. A browser that blocks all ads, tracking, and selectively allows cookies. It doesn't defend you like TOR will, but it will run faster than TOR, and for most browsing purposes, it is all you need. Download it today.
8. Metamask. A wallet/addon/UI for interacting with ethereum smart contracts. Download it, and run it on chrome, firefox or brave.",,,

socialism,Help us build a socialist left on campus,"We're a group of socialist activists at Monash University in Australia who want to build a socialist left on campus that can contribute to building the mass movements we're going to need to challenge capitalism and survive climate change.

Our campus is extremely corporate - they charge thousands of dollars just to book space for meetings or information stalls, all to make huge profits for the university while excluding ordinary students from the right to promote their ideas. Our student union is controlled by a coalition of students from the two major parties in Australia, who hate socialists or activism, and refuse to let students use their resources either.

Socialism is an internationalist ideology, so I thought we should reach out to comrades on this sub. I'm sure many of you around the world have been following the climate change-driven bushfires here. We need to build a socialist left that can make the clear argument that these fires are caused by capitalism.

socialism,Vanguardism a personal critique To me it seems like history shows that vanguardism is a great risk to take in order to create a workers democracy Its been acknowledged in representative democracies that there needs to be a power distribution amongst the people and the leaders in order to keep abuse from happening Historically however when the workers have shared their collective strength with a vanguard party theyve generally been treated disproportionate to the power they gave the vanguard The workers have that I know of been punished for discriminating the power when the workers feel like the vanguard i not representing their particular interests see the level of censorship in countries with Liberal vs Marxist backgrounds An argument of manufactured consent in liberalism can be made here though censorship which has been prevalent in vanguardism states is just another tool to create consent by misinforming the workers Vanguardism has always resulted in authoritarian states that tell the workers what socialism is It has in my opinion been shown to protect the socialism its leaders propose and oppose criticism which they themselves deem inappropriate not what the workers deem so This likely has to do with the idea of educating the working class instead of learning from itIn my opinion I think that instead of vanguarding and teaching workers we need to learn from the workers and put the collective in the front with educated socialists being simply spokespersons There needs to be a power distribution from the leaders to the workers from the start else itll be like putting faith in hoping for the goodwill of politicians even if socialist,"To me it seems like history shows that vanguardism is a great risk to take in order to create a worker's democracy. Its been acknowledged in representative democracies that there needs to be a power distribution amongst the people and the leaders in order to keep abuse from happening. Historically however, when the workers have shared their collective strength with a vanguard party, they've generally been treated disproportionate to the power they gave the vanguard. The workers have, that I know of, been punished for discriminating the power when the workers feel like the vanguard i not representing their particular interests (see the level of censorship in countries with Liberal vs Marxist backgrounds). An argument of ""manufactured consent in liberalism"" can be made here, though censorship, which has been prevalent in vanguardism states, is just another tool to create consent by misinforming the workers. 

Vanguardism has always resulted in authoritarian states that tell the workers what socialism is. It has in my opinion been shown to protect the socialism its leaders propose, and oppose criticism which they themselves deem inappropriate, not what the workers deem so. This likely has to do with the idea of educating the working class, instead of learning from it.

In my opinion, I think that instead of vanguarding and teaching workers, we need to learn from the workers and put the collective in the front with educated socialists being simply spokespersons. There needs to be a power distribution from the leaders to the workers from the start, else it'll be like putting faith in hoping for the goodwill of politicians, even if socialist.",,,

socialism,Neoliberals using shallow identity politics to hide the reality of their regressive class politics and some people on the left falling for this why I think this is occurring everywhere but has been mostly obvious in American politics for some time now The script goes like thisNeoliberal apparatchiks think that its too extreme with a medicare for all healthcare system According to them this will leave people working for insurance companies without a job Profits to the insurance and healthcare system cannot be challenged even if people cant afford insulin and 500 000 people go bankrupt every year from medical bills The status quo need to be maintained because profitsThis is how the neoliberals operate They will always protect the profiteers no matter how regressive and life threatening their politics are Just look at their affection for the fossil fuel industry Climate change is the biggest indicator on how neoliberals will put short term profits over the future of their children and grandchildren As a former neoliberal myself climate change is what made me open my eyes even though Ive always felt like the arguments from the left had some truth in itHowever neoliberals have come up with a tactic to refrain from talking class politics and acknowledging their regressiveness And that is weaponizing identity politics Youll see neoliberals from every corner using shallow identity politics whenever class is brought up in the discussionFor example Bernie Sanders was interviewed by the NYT and he explained in short words how the  profiteers use racism to divide and conquer and pit whites on the bottom against minorities Immediately a lashback from the neoliberals followed accusing him of being a racist The sexist smear didnt work so now theyre trying to paint him as racist although he has a splendid civil rights record and is the leading candidate of minorities in the USThe moment you bring up class in the discussion neoliberals will weaponize identity politics for their own gain but will actually never go through on delivering substancial policies that will help the mariginalized multiracial working class because theyre so bound to their white affluent constituency Woke shallow identity politics is what the affluent class use as a form of demagougery to hide the reality of their negative impact on ordinary working people What shocks me the most is that people on the left actually fall for this stuff Why,"I think this is occurring everywhere but has been mostly obvious in American politics for some time now. The script goes like this:

Neoliberal apparatchiks think that it's too extreme with a medicare for all healthcare system. According to them, this will leave people working for insurance companies without a job. Profits to the insurance and healthcare system cannot be challenged, even if people can't afford insulin and 500 000 people go bankrupt every year from medical bills. The status quo need to be maintained because profits.

This is how the neoliberals operate. They will always protect the profiteers no matter how regressive and life threatening their politics are. Just look at their affection for the fossil fuel industry. Climate change is the biggest indicator on how neoliberals will put short term profits over the future of their children and grandchildren. As a former neoliberal myself climate change is what made me open my eyes even though I've always felt like the arguments from the left had some truth in it.

However, neoliberals have come up with a tactic to refrain from talking class politics and acknowledging their regressiveness. And that is weaponizing identity politics. You'll see neoliberals from every corner using shallow identity politics whenever class is brought up in the discussion.

For example, Bernie Sanders was interviewed by the NYT and he explained in short words, how the  profiteers use racism to divide and conquer, and pit whites on the bottom against minorities. Immediately, a lashback from the neoliberals followed accusing him of being a racist. The sexist smear didn't work, so now they're trying to paint him as racist although he has a splendid civil rights record and is the leading candidate of minorities in the US.

The moment you bring up class in the discussion, neoliberals will weaponize identity politics for their own gain, but will actually never go through on delivering substancial policies that will help the mariginalized multiracial working class because they're so bound to their white affluent constituency. Woke, shallow identity politics is what the affluent class use as a form of demagougery to hide the reality of their negative impact on ordinary working people. 

What shocks me the most is that people on the left actually fall for this stuff. Why?",,,

""Communism goes against human nature, people in power will always be cruel and greedy""

And on and on and on.

Socialists have dealt with these arguments for hundreds of years. And they've been so easily debunked and are so cliche that they're fucking beyond boring at this point. Like, we deal with these arguments on a daily basis, yet capitalist apologists (at least the ones I know) act like they're making some bold and challenging statement by making them, but actual academics have historically had easy counterpoints to these claims. The discourse has run dry.

Like, why the fervent and unbending attachment to capitalism? I'm not obsessed with socialism to the point where I completely shut out the possibility of something better. Like, if an even better and more beneficial to mankind system is eventually conceived, you can bet I'm going over to that one.

And hope is simply impossible in such dark times when one half of our population has been so efficiently brainwashed that they would cut down even their childhood friends in name of an insidious ideology..

This is a message to the world - If in the near future, India becomes the very thing that our forefathers so hated, please remember that we weren't all Nazi, that there were people who opposed the racism.. we will fight until they get us too.. remember us, we fought!

socialism,Lets talk about West Virginia and the potential for praxis,"I was thinking about West Virginia as a possible powder keg for a future socialist revolution in America. This discussion applies to all types of leftists, since I will be talking about a Peoples War, which is something even anarchists tend to respect as a modern form of rebellion. 

Politics: 

\-While WV is a very conservative state and predominantly votes accordingly, I think this can be attributed to voter apathy and brainwashing, and they generally don't know what the cause of their problems is(capitalism).

\-Regardless of your opinion on Bernie Sanders, he beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 West Virginia Primary by EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016\_West\_Virginia\_Democratic\_primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_West_Virginia_Democratic_primary)) 

\-Bernie narrowly beats Trump in a recent head to head poll in WV. Although this is admittedly an outlier, it does show potential. ([https://tulchinresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/West-Virginia-Poll-Memo-409-A-5-18-Final.pdf](https://tulchinresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/West-Virginia-Poll-Memo-409-A-5-18-Final.pdf)) 

\-WV voters tend to be very apathetic and demoralized, case in point being they rank second to last in voter turnout. ([http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/voter-turnout-by-state](http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/voter-turnout-by-state/)) Give them a reason to have hope and be politically active.  

History: 

\-WV already has a history of worker struggle, the 1912-21 Coal Wars being a perfect example of this. Lets remind Appalachians of their roots. 

Environment and Economy:

\-WV is a big coal mining and chemical state, which has had lasting effects on their environment and health. It is important that people in WV where to point the finger for this.

\-More than 40% of West Virginia's rivers are polluted due to intentional and reckless actions by unregulated corporations. ([http://www.appalmad.org/slider/west-virginias-streams-are-in-trouble](http://www.appalmad.org/slider/west-virginias-streams-are-in-trouble/)) 

\-West Virginia has a long and bad history of lung diseases, due to massive pollution and a lack of care for coal miners. ([https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/health/study-black-lung-growing-especially-in-central-appalachia/article\_be47c666-2b54-5b78-bc90-7f545373316d.html](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/health/study-black-lung-growing-especially-in-central-appalachia/article_be47c666-2b54-5b78-bc90-7f545373316d.html)) 

\-Many coal workers are being left behind in the changing economy, and I think it's important to help them adjust accordingly, especially with green jobs. 

\-West Virginia has a long history of poverty, being one of the poorest states in the country. This has the potential of only getting worse. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_U.S.\_states\_by\_GDP\_per\_capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_capita)) ([https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-poverty-rate-is-up-and-has-not-decreased/article\_bbc6689e-99ea-5bc7-983e-2ffb9b44d734.html](https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-poverty-rate-is-up-and-has-not-decreased/article_bbc6689e-99ea-5bc7-983e-2ffb9b44d734.html))

\-Poverty leads to radicalization, which is why its important to spread class consciousness in the region. If we don't, that radicalization will swing rightwards.

The Peoples War: 

\-If anybody is thinking of the perfect place to start a Peoples War in America, I believe WV is a great candidate. In fact, this is one of the biggest reasons why I'm making this post. 

\-For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of PW, it is a Maoist method of revolution for the modern technological era. It starts in one region, which then spreads throughout the rest of the country in a patient, longterm way. It involves nomadic guerrilla warfare, which the Vietcong effectively used America. 

\-WV is extremely mountainous and forested, and has a bunch of angry rednecks with guns who know how to use them. This is a perfect recipe for guerilla warfare.

Conclusion: It's important to look at West Virginia in a strategic sense moving forward. I would also like to urge people to please give others patience and time to become breadpilled and conscious, particularly rednecks. I am not a class reductionist whatsoever, but many poor rednecks have been subjugated to extreme levels of brainwashing and misery.",,,

**Fascist Signifiers**

I have been reading fascist discussions from leftists of the early 20th century recently, and I think it would be helpful to make a list of reoccurring signifiers I noticed for fascism. Watch out for these! 

1**)A Critique of Capitalism Based on Culture, Not Class.**

Look out for right-wingers suddenly riling against big corporations, or free trade, etc., while ignoring class conflict in favor of cultural decay. (i.e Big corporations are destroying our \[blank\] culture!)

2)**Claiming Class Differences Are Not Real, But Cultural Ones Are.**

Look out for anyone claiming that class differences are unimportant, and that mentioning class struggle undermines the unity of \[insert nationality or ethnicity/culture\]. Bonus points if they claim ‘Classism’ is the new racism.

3) **'Corporatism'**

The word ‘corporatism’, or anyone who recommends the government, and society at large, should be run 'like a corporation'.

4) **Sovverisivo**

Claiming to be ‘sovverisivo’, or subversive, or ‘counter culture’, while fundamentally maintaining a right-wing pro-capitalist viewpoint, albeit with a bit of extreme variation.

5) **Mythical Past Legacy**

 Any notion of a mythical past history of the \[nation or culture or race\], or any movement that seeks to undo \[nation’s or culture’s or race’s\] fall from the greatness that they just made up.

6) **War Never Changes**

 Any fetishism of war for war’s sake.

7) **'Foux Anti Élitism'**

Any claims that they are riling against the èlite, when in actuality by èlite, they mean some vaguely left-wing ‘Cultural Bolshevik’, be they a socialist, student, or Avante-guarde artist.

8) **Unity of the State**

Last of all- if they claim all culture, class conflict, and struggle, can be united and resolved under a state, run. They are a fascist.

&amp;#x200B;

If you spot any of these, especially 1,2,3,5 and 8, be concerned.",,,

socialism,My case for defenestration over the guillotine,"So I have always been interested in history and I came across something interesting a while ago. Pretty much since the French revolution we on the left have used and joked about the use of the guillotine. But I think I found a knew equivalent in defenestration, particularly the instance of the first defenestration of Prague and the Hussites. I have been intrested in the Hussite movement for a while, as I am a Druid-Catholic and obviously a socialist view point of Christianity, and the Hussites generally pushed for many reforms that I would believe were needed (moremoneyto the poor, ending paying money for forgiveness of sins...). It's interesting because the way they deal with Lords who apposed them was literally throwing them out windows, which seems hilarious the idea of doing to the rich vs the guillotine. It also has a wider affect as ""King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, after hearing the news, was stunned and died shortly after, supposedly due to shock"" from the first mass defenestration in Prague, so it is also far reaching.

She is known for delivering sharp criticism of capitalist pigs and misguided leftists alike.  If you're not familiar with her or her work and would like to know more, I've linked and briefly summarized a few of her works below. And since I know that none of us here actually want to read theory, I've also provided a series of short excerpts that I hope you'll find not only enlightening, but also disappointingly still relevant. [Obligatory thumbnail](https://i.imgur.com/88cfqRi.jpg)

# [1898 - Opportunism and the Art of the Possible](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1898/09/30.htm) (Word count~1,100)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg addresses the question of how a far left political party can work within a political system dominated by bourgeois parties .
* **Notable Excerpt:** ""Precisely because we do not yield one inch from our position, we force the government and the bourgeois parties to concede to us the few immediate successes that can be gained. But if we begin to chase after what is ‘possible’ according to the principles of opportunism, unconcerned with our own principles, and by means of statesmanlike barter, then we will soon find ourselves in the same situation as the hunter who has not only failed to stay the deer but has also lost his gun in the process.""

# [1899 - Speech to the Hanover Congress](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1899/10/11.htm) (Word Count~2,500)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg explains why revolution (though not necessarily bloodshed) is required for socialism to emerge.
* **Notable Excerpt:** ""if we want to learn from history, we see that all previous class struggles have gone as follows: through legal reforms and small steps forward, the rising class grew stronger within the limits of the old society, until it was strong enough to cast off its old shackles *by means of a social and political catastrophe*. It had to be done that way, in spite of the fact that the rising class could develop its economic power to its highest point within the womb of the old ruling class. For us that upheaval will be ten times more necessary...  we are striving for a complete transformation of the ruling capitalist economic order, which can be attained only through seizing state power and never on the path of social reform within the confines of existing society. ""

# [1899 - The Militia and Militarism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1899/02/26.htm) (Word Count~5,250)

* **What it's about:** Because of it's dependency on context from other politicians, this one might not be too riveting unless it's a topic that particularly interests you. However, it contains some very good bits on the evils of militarism that I want to highlight.
* **Notable Excerpts: ""**...by accepting militarism, the worker prevents his wages from being reduced by a certain amount, but in return is largely deprived of the possibility of fighting continuously for an increase in his wage and an improvement of his situation. He gains as a seller of his labour, but at the same time loses his political freedom of movement as a citizen, so that he must ultimately also lose as the seller of his labour. He removes a competitor from the labour market only to see a defender of his wage slavery arise in his place; he prevents his wages being lowered only to find that the prospects both of a permanent improvement in his situation and of his ultimate economic, political and social liberation are diminished"" as well as ""\[What\] makes supplying the military in particular essentially more profitable than, for example, State expenditures on cultural ends (schools, roads, etc.), is the incessant technical innovations of the military and the incessant increase in its expenditures. Militarism thus represents an inexhaustible, and indeed increasingly lucrative, source of capitalist gain, and raises capital to a social power of the magnitude confronting the worker...  which to society as a whole represents a completely absurd economic waste of enormous productive forces – and which for the working class means a lowering of its standard of living with the objective of enslaving it socially – is for the capitalist class economically the most alluring, irreplaceable kind of investment and politically and socially the best support for their class rule. ""

# [1903 - Marxist Theory and the Proletariat](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1903/03/14-abs.htm) (Word Count~3,000)

* **What it's about:**  Luxemburg gives her opinion on the significance of Marxism to the working class
* **Notable excerpt: ""** In this manner, Marx's theory penetrates and enlightens everything — the moral power, by which we overcome perils; our tactics of struggle, even its last details; our critique of opponents; our everyday agitation, by which we win the masses; our entire work down to the tips of the fingers. And if we here and there indulge in the illusion that our politics is today with all its inner power independent from Marx's theory, then this only shows that our praxis speaks in Marx's terms although we do not know it...""

# [1904 - In the Storm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/05/01.htm) (Word Count~500)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg chimes in on why war is evil
* **Notable excerpt:** ""\[The  Russo-Japanese War\] brings the gaze of the international proletariat back to the great political and economic connectedness of the world, and violently dissipates in our ranks the particularism, the pettiness of ideas that form in any period of political calm. The war completely rends all the veils which the bourgeois world – this world of economic, political and social fetishism – constantly wraps us in... war unleashes – at the same time as the reactionary forces of the capitalist world – the generating forces of social revolution which ferment in its depths.""

# [1904 - Organizational Questions of the Russian Social Democracy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/questions-rsd/ch01.htm) (Word Count~7,000)

* **What it's about:** AKA Leninism or Marxism, this essay contains Luxemburg's opinion on the necessity, or rather lack thereof, of centralization to the establishment of Socialist organizations.
* **Notable excerpts:** ""...\[The\] two principles on which Lenin’s centralism rests are precisely these:

1. The blind subordination, in the smallest detail, of all party organs to the party center which alone thinks, guides, and decides for all.
2. The rigorous separation of the organized nucleus of revolutionaries from its social-revolutionary surroundings.""

""...The indispensable conditions for the realization of Social Democratic centralism are:

1. The existence of a large contingent of workers educated in the class struggle.
2. The possibility for the workers to develop their own political activity through direct influence on public life, in a party press, and public congresses, etc.""

And ""*Nothing will more surely enslave a young labor movement to an intellectual elite hungry for power than this bureaucratic straightjacket, which will immobilize the movement and turn it into an automaton manipulated by a Central Committee.* On the other hand there is no more effective guarantee against opportunist intrigue and personal ambition than the independent revolutionary action of the proletariat, as a result of which the workers acquire the sense of political responsibility and self-reliance. What is today only a phantom haunting Lenin’s imagination may become reality tomorrow.""

# [1906 - Riot and Revolution Speech by Rosa Luxemburg on Trial for Inciting to Riot](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1906/misc/riot-revolution.htm) (Word Count~2,100)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg tactfully responds to allegations of inciting the use of public force. She is ultimately found guilty and imprisoned for 2 months.
* **Notable excerpt:** ""Do you believe that masses of people could be incited to use physical force against the ruling class merely by a few words on the Revolution, when you consider that these same masses kept their temper admirably all the time the capitalist class enforced their anti-Socialist law, their penal servitude enactment directed against free speech and press, their measures for increasing working-class starvation and, last but not least, their Bill for smashing up the workers’ economic organisation? I am surprised that the Public Prosecutor has not, instead of prosecuting me, brought to book the originators of those laws and Bills, for these deeds are apt to stir up immensely the propertyless masses and would most certainly lead to physical force excesses if – yes, if it were not for Socialism’s enlightening and elevating influence.""

# [1912 - Women's Suffrage and Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1912/05/12.htm) (Word Count~2,250)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg outlines the urgent necessity  of women's suffrage in relationship to the proletarian struggle.
* **Notable excerpt:** ""Women’s suffrage is the goal. But the mass movement to bring it about is not a job for women alone, but is a common class concern for women and men of the proletariat. Germany’s present lack of rights for women is only one link in the chain of the reaction that shackles the people’s lives. And it is closely connected with the other pillar of the reaction: the monarchy. In advanced capitalist, highly industrialized, twentieth-century Germany, in the age of electricity and airplanes, the absence of women’s political rights is as much a reactionary remnant of the ‘dead past as the reign by Divine Right on the throne.""

# [1915 - Theses on the Tasks of International Social-Democracy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/xx/theses.htm) (WC~1,600)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg lays out 6 clear guiding principles of socialism.  In doing so she heavily emphasizes the internationalist leaning of socialism in opposition to rising nationalist ideologies.
* **Notable excerpt:** Read all 6 of her points, they're collectively made of fewer than 500 words. But if you really need an excerpt take this ""The immediate mission of socialism is the spiritual liberation of the proletariat from the tutelage of the bourgeoisie, which expresses itself through the influence of nationalist ideology. The national Sections must agitate in the parliaments and the press, denouncing the empty wordiness of nationalism as an instrument of bourgeois domination. The sole defense of all real national independence is at present the revolutionary class struggle against imperialism. The workers’ fatherland, to the defense of which all else must be subordinated, is the socialist International.""

# [1918 - The Socialisation of Society](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/12/20.htm)  (Word Count~1,350)

* **What it's about:** ""The question of how a future socialist society may look is scarcely found in the Marxist literature. Rosa Luxemburg took up this question in an article written in the heat of the revolution, in December 1918."" (quote taken from the note made by the linked source)
* **Notable excerpt:** ""Currently all wealth – the largest and best estates as well as the mines, works and the factories – belongs to a few Junkers and private capitalists. The great mass of the workers only get from these Junkers and capitalists a meagre wage to live on for hard work. The enrichment of a small number of idlers is the aim of today’s economy. This state of affairs should be remedied. All social wealth, the land with all its natural resources hidden in its bowels and on the surface, and all factories and works must be taken out of the hands of the exploiters and taken into common property of the people. The first duty of a real workers’ government is to declare by means of a series of decrees the most important means of production to be national property and place them under the control of society.""

# [1918 - What Does the Spartacus League Want](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/12/14.htm) (Word Count~3,200)

* **What it's about:** Luxemburg highlights the immediate urgency of socialist salvation in the face of a crumbling capitalist society. She outlines a series of demands made by the  [Spartacus League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_League), which are  divided into three sections: immediate measures to protect the revolution, political/social demands, and economic demands.
* **Notable excerpt:** ""The establishment of the socialist order of society is the mightiest task which has ever fallen to a class and to a revolution in the history of the world. This task requires a complete transformation of the state and a complete overthrow of the economic and social foundations of society. This transformation and this overthrow cannot be decreed by any bureau, committee, or parliament. It can be begun and carried out only by the masses of people themselves. In all previous revolutions a small minority of the people led the revolutionary struggle, gave it aim and direction, and used the mass only as an instrument to carry its interests, the interests of the minority, through to victory. The socialist revolution is the first which is in the interests of the great majority and can be brought to victory only by the great majority of the working people themselves. The mass of the proletariat must do more than stake out clearly the aims and direction of the revolution. It must also personally, by its own activity, bring socialism step by step into life. The essence of socialist society consists in the fact that the great laboring mass ceases to be a dominated mass, but rather, makes the entire political and economic life its own life and gives that life a conscious, free, and autonomous direction.""",,,

I live in a suburban area in the Midwest and I am interested in creating a local Socialist group to address local needs. There is definite interest in socialism here (among the right people), but no official groups. I’m not looking to form an official DSA or SPUSA chapter at the moment — just looking to grow a small group of like-minded socialists to work on local issues and build camaraderie. Perhaps if our group became very successful in a few years, we could join a larger group, but that isn’t my intent currently. And for the record, the nearest Socialist organization is about 1.5-2 hours away.

That brings me to my main point: What are some local government issues that we could organize around to improve the lives of the working people? I’m strictly referring to local government tasks, since I’m already well-aware of national issues like M4A. 

Also, have any of you organized a local socialist group? How did you approach it? I have a small network of like-minded people, but I’m obviously looking to expand beyond that.",,,

socialism,Surplus under socialism,"I am going to base everything in this post of of the system presented in this video: https://youtu.be/kQoEqBx70ts

The capitalist manner of extracting surplus is through forcefully appropriating value created by a worker. Under the Marxist leninists system (the system proposed in the video) it is said that the initial extraction, or the process through which what was previously capitalist surplus, is acquired, remains, but that it is then reinvested in societal benefits/ programs. The surplus it is said, finds its way indirectly back to its owner. But now a new form of surplus extraction emerges from this system: there persists no proportionality between the actual value secured from these infasructures, and the magnitude of the value contributed. Our analysis shows that here too surplus manifests, it's size being much smaller of course, but still existent, a socialist surplus. My question now is, why not transfer ownership of the surplus to the worker immediately after creation, instead of after, where he finds himself with a morphed version of the surplus? I know that if we do not possess and advanced computer based labour credit system this difference between received value and produced value cannot be done away with, but I think even just only letting the workplace itself decide how to divide the profits would deal a heavy blow to this surplus, and be a much more reduced variant than the socialist surplus. Why not even combine the 2 methods?",,,

From what I understand, every socialist has been through this particular circus show at least once.

I have a friend/acquaintance. He's a good guy, works at a pizza place, wants to be a combat medic. We're talking one day, and he says some vaguely nationalist thing. In this case, it was that 1960s government should have only been combated with peaceful protest, and that more assertive measures like the Black Panther party were way out of line, because 'violence begets violence'.

I can already hear alarm bells ringing in my head. I should probably just leave this topic alone, I think. He's allowed to have his opinions, he can do whatever he wants, if you tried to talk him out of it that would probably just come off as offensive.

But he's WRONG, I think. He's wrong and if I was able to convince him he'd finally get it. He's a good guy, and I think that he would change his mind.

It follows out pretty much how you'd expect. I ask him if he'd be comfortable if I shared more 'controversial' opinions (aka, opinions that don't agree with him). He says sure! He likes deep thinking, he's a rationalist. Everyone likes a little debate between friends, right?

I counter with something he said from earlier. Just a few minutes ago we were talking about how upset you were that they aren't sending enough weapon aid to certain military combatants fighting in Syria. Isn't that the same situation, going against the law and taking action into your own hands to fight for what's right?

This back and forth goes back for a while, until he sends me a pretty long couple of paragraphs of waffly bullshit that boils down to 'there's a certain invisible line, and then when you cross it fighting back is okay. Racism in the 1960s didn't cross that line, but this particular fight in Syria does.' and- this is almost word for word- 'it wasn't as bad as, like, genocide. They weren't killing people, they were just oppressing them and making shit worse.'

I was genuinely a little taken aback, and if I'm being honest, a little frightened. People think like this! What he said was blatantly, provably wrong, and I could show him with articles that it wasn't.

I write a little bit of a speech, if I'm being honest. Four or five paragraphs, focusing a lot on COINTELPRO and various other awful things the government has done up to this point. At the end I feature a little bibliography of all the sources I used, urging him to read them for himself and draw his own conclusions. This time, I think. This time I can convince someone with facts and evidence and compelling words that maybe the US government isn't that great after all.

I don't really know what I was thinking, now. He says that he'll read it over later, but he gets pretty offended and saying that I was thinking 'whether or not he was a good person over politics'. I try to tell him that that wasn't what I meant at all, and that was why I started with saying 'I think you're a good person, you're just wrong'. He says that he's decided he doesn't ever really want to talk about this again.

I don't like losing friends. I don't like arguing, either. I just see a little sparkle of hope that maybe I can convince people I'm not out of my mind about all this stuff. Was there any way I could have gotten through to him? Was I being a nosy prick for trying to tell him that this just isn't the way the world works? Was there any different point of action, or should I just have not tried at all?",,,

This leaves many people (including children) in the streets or living with family/friends.

Many like to complain about these people. The issue of course is that this is actually how Capitalism is ***supposed*** to work. Under this system, if a person doesn't have enough numbers, they are automatically in a position of need. Having lots of people in need constantly is not considered a flaw by Capitalism. It's things going as planned.

For this reason, ""leeches"" shouldn't upset any person who supports Capitalism. It's literally part of ***your*** system. It's how it is meant to function. If you support Capitalism you absolutely support a system that isn't planning on helping these people. It plans on leaving them in your streets or in the basements of their parents.

socialism,Red Guards Austin RGA have assaulted Austin DSAbacked congressional candidate RGA is cancer,"Red Guard Austin (RGA) is actively disrupting and antagonizing the Austin DSA. Yesterday (1/12), after rallying before a canvass (in which 128 volunteers came to knock on doors to get people to support her, Bernie, and the GND!), they assaulted [Heidi Sloan](https://heidisloan.com/issues/), who is running for congress in TX-25 and is a DSA member. [Here is Heidi's facebook post on the matter](https://www.facebook.com/HeidiSloanForTX/posts/161579448508973?__xts__[0]=68.ARByBBuKSFqrgUhG1Hq_KZWRrnl3R3nR2gbqYvvM0OM8bv1J2M04XmW5dgcXfvWLCYlF_VAhSUTp4Fj19y2Gflf1wDZJ3P1Fqmc2SPgvIjDIRKZKnpAttIL6VmZHkqLAOeIQVpFiP3_8MpjSRH7bqRpNZxabLL-JQ_ZoMC1ObYiVKgmM90PfVpzyAbj4XpB2DtStWfTqBD_8UxuhUXM0NxppxxVAReC8sxbhEFT1J1QHKv-UACX2Ylzqf_x4Br8wyISRguDvQ4KtXqdsZDtCH1Gn2llpACqgxmY-C2yu1d7LCOCvaPXlbPlDWJmoL3Wob-vnWAdK-gqwQ6Y6mOs&amp;__tn__=-R):

&gt; Today I was assaulted by members of Red Guards Austin following their attempted disruption of our biggest canvass to date.

&gt;Red Guards Austin (RGA) is a radical cult in our city that suppresses democracy and I’ve become their target. This group goes by many different names - Defend Our Hoodz, Stonewall Militant Front, Popular Women’s Movement, Frente de Liberacion Immigrante, Incendiary News, Serve the People Austin. They have come to disrupt DSA’s educational events, hung a pig’s head outside of a public library, tagged the AFL-CIO with graffiti, and disrupted other organizations’ community events.

&gt;The main form of organizing by RGA is targeting black, brown and working-class neighborhoods with campaigns to suppress voter turnout, posting flyers and graffiti that say, “Elections no, revolution yes”, “Vote no, revolutions yes”, “Don’t vote, fight for revolution.” They have defaced election signs and the Beto for Senate campaign office.

&gt;Today, over 125 volunteers gathered to block walk in our neighborhoods. RGA attempted to disrupt our event. We engaged in de-escalation until this group left. Their actions did not prevent the most successful canvass in this campaign’s or in Austin DSA’s history.

&gt;Following the canvass, I left Givens Park to meet volunteers for a post-canvass social event. Members from RGA followed my car. As I walked away from my car they ambushed me from an alley, circled me, and physically prevented me from returning to my vehicle to leave. A man in the group assaulted me, shoving me and smashing eggs filled with red paint on my head and on my car. I know I am not the only woman who has been harassed by this group.

&gt;RGA is clearly committed to using violence and intimidation to suppress democracy. They target candidates with progressive values and want to deter working class people, especially working class people of color, from participating in the political process.

&gt;I have an unshakable conviction in democracy and organizing - in our workplaces, in our homes and in our society. Anyone who stands against democracy is my enemy.

&gt;I have become their target because our movement is showing a way for working class people to build our power and fight for control of our lives––they know we can win.

&gt;I am fiercely proud of the solidarity shown by the people in our movement today. We sang songs, had each others’ backs and deescalated the situation at the canvass. The disruption did not stop our organizing efforts. It did not prevent us knocking more than 3000 doors.

&gt;The safety of our volunteers is our number one priority, and moving forward we will be taking greater precautions. But rest assured we will not be stopped by this and we will continue to build this movement. We shall not be moved.

RGA, who blog under the name ""Incendiary News"" posted [this](https://www.facebook.com/incendiarynews/posts/2349336348691028?__xts__[0]=68.ARCZxAbq5btOXGsZimfYmzB64iVz2JzVJTftKlOGova_fuS0Z2-t_pMphSpSEi4u4-Jbb3u9uja1nDZq1avYxV7ITpcJnaegosuoOdaNkdj75hrcql_Lk19Pt7MRAY2lFQAHnmZdpegzu9tRLQRXI4ludfay8Ea7UIJgc-_W95Q78KjWL2pMARlny-hlnjxgjT98Qj3KgzQydN-fk8kebYW92P_tMZCrWKfTydgJ0RMt8CLe7vbKxIHWJzFqQomNZFouLC9i6xfX00xL-h7AVg13HAkmduRKGuWABHIpy2WWh3A-PbchhiCGnxuvefbADrCj910OvJC956xJJ1arK86WiuWM&amp;__tn__=-R) on their facebook page to then glorify their assault. 

Last week, RGA disrupted an Austin DSA anti-war rally at the Texas Capitol. They antagonized members and tried to fight them. A small fashy group of trump supporter called the Texas Nomads also made an appearance. DSA members told them they weren't welcome and ignored them. The RGA claimed the Austin DSA are pro-US imperialism (???) and that they were protecting fascists. 

This has to fucking stop. RGA are not only attacking socialists who are true to the cause, but are telling working class folk to *not* vote at all. It is clear that RGA does not care about organizing coalitions and building solidarity. RGA is a cancer and we as socialists need to do something about it.",,,

It’s winter and I smoke like a fire so I didn’t think much of it. Flash forward to about a week ago when I had to go to the emergency room because I couldn’t breathe. Turns out I had been suffering from the flu for about 2 days prior to it and due to a few medical conditions it escalated fast. 
The first thing doctor asked was why I didn’t come in right away when I felt sick. And I told him that I got fired outright for complaining to management about how much of the factory has osha violations. Piss poor ventilation, blocked exits, etc. and that I could not afford to come in and still can’t. 

So when my family found out there was two more questions/statements that they needed to ask after that really got to me about how bad society is. The first was “Well if you didn’t want to go into debt with medical bills, why did you go to a hospital?” And “Maybe you shouldn’t have complained about work being bad.” 

How in the f-... My own flesh and blood is telling me to, a) just probably die if I get sick. And b) don’t care if the place you work at may not follow the law. Is this common with anyone else? Has anyone else had a similar realization that modern society has very warped sense of what you should and shouldn’t do?",,,

📷

I don't understand. Couple of months ago in the city I live (Montreal) we had close to 500K people in the street marching to fight against climate change. Many politicians were on the front line to show their support (Personally I think they just wanted to show their faces since the elections were around the corner). From that massive event until now nothing tangible was but on the table. No task force, no think tank , nothing coming close to an international consensus on the matter. Now is the time to take a real look in the mirror. I think that a vast majority can no longer close their eyes on the reality of climate change (Bare in mind this is not the only issue our societies are facing but at least it's the one were less personal interest are at stake). I hear many complaints about climato-sceptics who mainly lack scientific information, the willingness to act because it against there own personal interest or whatever argument they want to come up with. But what about the 500k Climato-flexible people.They did walk once but then what ? One of the biggest challenge of our time is in front of us (I invite you to take a look at the video in the link). Australia doesn't need money they need help, they need human ressources they need compassion they need to feel that they are not left alone (Once again I know that it's not the only place on earth that needs that kind of attention but it would be a good start since I doubt any voice could rise against). I invite everyone to share this in order that our Governing bodies start acting. As a Canadian Citizen I request and expect my government to show the example and for once act in the benefit of everyone by sending every possible ressources (Army, firefighters, food even fucking snow). Because believe it or not it is a matter of national security for all the countries. It might not be in front of your eyes but doesn't mean its not happening. Let's show everyone that we can make a difference. If no one wants to listen, well I guess we'll have to do it ourselves.

I invite anyone that want to help to join forces in order to find a way to solves this issue and many more to come.

To anyone that read until the end. Thank you",,,

But he is also an entertainer doing comedy and he has such a large influence that can impact billions of people with not much endeavour and psychological studies have also already linked humour to be a convincing factor while having the judgemental guard or individual guarding. Even if you google search right now a little bit to see how swearing is highly associated with [greater persuasiveness](https://www-indy100-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.indy100.com/article/swearing-makes-you-more-persuasive-studies-say-7345901?amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQOKAGYAcuV2MW3htqK7QE%3D&amp;amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indy100.com%2Farticle%2Fswearing-makes-you-more-persuasive-studies-say-7345901) which is also a factor that might be influencing people's vote right leaning . 

So if you are a pecuniary right wing conservative i would like to explicate myself because even me for myself would have felt unsettled in the past seeing things like that so i want to explain my post through an Eastern European regiment standpoint ( in the sense of a Nording or Swedish tradition ) 
I myself support the taxation of profit interests of large companies and the 3%. 
Since these people wont end up struggling , not in poverty , JUST LESS FUCKING RICH , since most of thr non commomers won't even get the chance to spend all that money , and there are people who wasn't born from as advanced backgrounds , families , social supports and upbringings as you so if some won the genetic lottery and had the best access to education that won't make it any less bad if other people can equally have the same fucking approach to academic scholarship or literacy so that we can have a balance of classes and i wouldn't want to let those things pass as a joke , if the media is willing to ask Felix for apologies for everything else they might as well attack him for this since it's not the first time Pewds does expresses his libertarian views. I still think he is funny but he has no obligation talking about things the has no objective to do , he is just a good entertainer and it should remain this way",,,

With the current events, a before seemingly unlikely war, between the USA and Iran, might be on our doorstep. 

The Iranian government is horrible, lets not defend it. That would be like defending the Nazis because many Germans died, it is sad that German civilians were killed, but that does not make the actions of Hitler any better. However, a foreign invasion is one of the most uniting things to people. Instead of doing its intended goal of unseating a terrible dictatorship, it will only unify any fracture in the state to fight off invaders. Then on the other side of the possible conflict is the USA  who might attack them because they killed an Iranian general and the Iranians are fighting back. They started this conflict, and even though as possibly better government might be set up, that will not last and it will just be a American friendly satellite. 

However the only people that will truly lose in this conflict is the proletariat. Possibly hundreds of thousands of Iranian civilians will die in a conflict that they didn't even want. It will at least turn into Iraq and Afghanistan, and it might even have a similar outcome as the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. The Iranian government will lose, but they will either be captured or they can flee to safety in another country. The American people will only lose soldiers in a conflict they do not want. The only ones to profit are Saudi Arabia and the American government. Saudi Arabia can assert their influence over the region with other Sunnis in South Iran (as Iran is a ethnic and religious mess that might explode with the destruction of the central government). Saudi Arabia is even worse than the Iranian government, with no rights for women and extremely strict religious laws against homosexuals and anyone that is not a Muslim. The USA will be able to assert their power in the region and the Iranian oil fields and will have to deal with the mess they created.

The Iranian state would be in collapse, with the entire country becoming a war zone and with high death tolls on the American and Iranian soldiers and even higher ones on the Iranian people. Other, terrible, terrorist and extremist groups will take power in a large power vacuum. There might be an even larger insurgency. Other groups might split off creating even more conflict that will last for decades to come.

A revolution and overthrowing of a government should not be by a foreign power, that will only strengthen the government. A revolution that is FOR the people should be created BY the people. I myself hope that these revolutions come to Saudi Arabia and Iran, but for now I can only hope. The situation is still undetermined and the future will only say what will happen, however, because of the headstrong (and foolish) nature of President Trump, a war grows ever more likely. A full blown war, might not happen, that is up to Congress, but a border conflict is raging already.",,,

He has a pretty great episode on Historical Materialism — as well as good one on Three Pillars of Marxism. Revolutions Podcast can be listened on most Podcast platforms. 

[10.3- The Three Pillars of Marxism
According to Lenin, Karl Marx was, ""the genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy, and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general.”](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2019/06/103-the-three-pillars-of-marxism.html)

All over the country there was a complete stoppage and not only that, in some regions and towns the workers took over the running of society, declaring ‘soviets’ and workers’ councils to be in charge. The aim of the strike was to secure the release of prisoners being held by the British authorities in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin and, after two days, the strike ended with a complete victory.

I did some thinking and research about voluntary socialism lately.

You know, since open source software is open to use and usually doesn't cost anything it pretty much perfectly fits with socialist ideals.

If you add p2p networks like Bittorrent or Bitcoin and think how it's literally ""peer-2-peer"" or ""person-2-person"" and a peer is generally known as an ""equal part of a whole"" in such networks, again it fits perfectly.

Of course is some forms of socialism depending on how much force you want to use you night not want such free distribution out of respect for intellectual property rights, probably especially today!

Even though most open source inventions whether they are networks or just simple apps they usually come out of the marketplace meaning they are not funded by any governments but rely wholely on their userbase and also their voluntary contributions.

I guess there is a lot to be said about crowdfunding generally aswell but is not really that relevant to in regards to the whole open source topic.

But you see where i am going with this.

So i am asking you, as a libertarian who sees most of this as a ""market phenomena"", 

why;

if you are a socialist running mac or windows, don't you switch to any modern Linux distribution and help build the free voluntary markerplace for software and networks!

It will improve our Privacy/Security/Accessibility so much over the long term

""Nothing will happen""!

Agree with your analysis! But any solution you would like to give us or forget the issue?

You and me and those; who have become or will become inactive and who take the present economic, social, political order a permanent feature (or at least a long lasting one); are further sunk, probably will be in depression or will deviate to the right wing ideology, like any social democrats and anti revolutionaries! It is fertile base for opportunism, deviation and revisionism!

Eve if the situation is very reactionary, facing ""Indian"" fascism, state sponsored violence and repression, where the mass and their ""communists"" have accepted Neo-Liberalism as a fate accomplice, we the revolutionaries, who understand what is Historical Materialism, must continue our work, at least as part of AgitProp on ground! We, the Marxist Leninists, must grow and strengthen our party, ideologically as well as organizationally, keep educating the mass politically, make them class conscious as much as possible!

Comrades! All is not doomed, do not underestimate what happened on 08 Jan, 2020 and happening now!! We are witnessing a historical movement in India, working class and oppressed people are on road in a big way, do not let this movement pass away without any gains, even if we fail to achieve any revolutionary change!

This is Class Struggle, even if in dormant form! Be part of it and do not wait for it to pass away and write ""The lessons of 2020 Mass Movement""! Lastly remember, we are not alone! The world is witnessing such mass revolts, threatening the base of imperialist capitalism!

the_donald,MOD TEAM TOUR SHILL EDITION,"The website: www.TheDonald.win

The Discord: https://discord.gg/rd3r4N8

The Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedonaldreddit

The subreddit: /r/The_Donald

#MOD TEAM TOUR: SHILL EDITION

In light of Reddit's mass demodding of our moderators, and Reddit's attempt at installing their own team, we've decided that none of the applicants are qualified at this time, and we must resort to opening up a new temp team.

As a moderator, you will have to do your part in moderating upwards of a thousand daily reports, and 4000+ additional comments daily that our systems flag as high risk. Unfortunately, this wasn't enough for Reddit as seen in our mass demodding, so the workload is likely to increase further.

Janitors who complete a tour will be granted a spicy ""SHILL"" flair that might command the respect of patriots everywhere! After you complete your tour, you are welcome to either re-apply for another tour, or you could even be selected to become a permanent mod! (A number of our current moderators were chosen from past temp teams!)

#March's campaign is Operation: SHILLS

######How to apply:

####Please fill out the questionnaire below and send  a [modmail to r/The_Donald_mod_apps](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FThe_Donald_mod_apps) 

#1. If you already have a Discord account, what is your name + 4 number code? (A Discord account is required for interviews and modding.)

#2. Why you want to be a part of this taskforce? 

#3. What time zone you are in?

#4. How many hours a day you can realistically spend on moderation?

#5. What times (in Eastern) are you available to mod?

#6. Who did you vote for in the primary? (If applicable.)

#7. How long have you been a subscriber of The_Donald?

#8. Age? 

#9. If you have any alt accounts you'd like to share, please list them. (Only if you are comfortable doing so.)

#10. How would you describe concern trolling and how would you moderate for this?

#11. Add a brief message of why you want to be a part of this taskforce and how many hours a week you can realistically spend on moderation, and if you get selected in the first round, we will be in touch with the next steps. 

#12. What's your Win account called?

In addition to this, Reddit has disallowed us to pick our own moderators. You must meet their criteria:

- Be in good standing with our Safety team (e.g. no account suspensions in past year)
- Have at least 1000 total karma
- Have at least 500 karma in the_donald
- Not have more than 500 karma in quarantined subreddits (aside from the_donald) or subreddits banned for rule violations (not including communities banned for being unmodded)
- Have at least 1 month experience moderating a subreddit in good standing
- Not be an alt of any ineligible accounts

---

####This will be fast-paced and we can only take people who can put in a sizable daily/weekly time commitment in straight moderation warfare.

###DO NOT APPLY IN THE COMMENTS OF THIS POST.

---

####Application deadline for TEAM SHILLS is MIDNIGHT Saturday, March 14th @ 11:59PM TRUMP TIME (EASTERN).

the_donald,If you decide to remain on Reddit you should take a minute to review the current content policy You can not behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit,"Reddit has implemented and deployed a mass banning tool that will eventually ban you if you upvote content that is against their content policy. This tool is set up so it can ban ten-twenty thousand people at a time, with a single action. A Reddit administrator marking a popular post as a ""content violation"" will cause everyone who upvoted it to be banned. So if you decide to stay it's actually useful to check what you will get banned for. Spoiler: it can be almost anything. This policy changed significantly several months ago so many of you may not even know what the current policy is. Here are a few examples: 

&gt;[If you ""behave in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit"" - you will be banned. ](https://archive.is/PYJtg#selection-229.248-229.353)

Remember that 'reasonable person' is not defined as YOU, a Trump supporter might understand it. It is defined as Reddit administrators understand what it means to be 'reasonable'. We don't know what that is but here is some helpful information: According to Wikipedia, Reddit is headquartered in [San_Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_San_Francisco) which has under 10% GOP representation, if I understand the data right. Just be aware that their definition of 'reasonable' is not your own. If you upvote anything that falls into the above category you will also be banned. 

&gt;[If you ""bully"" someone you will be banned. ](https://archive.is/PYJtg#selection-159.28-159.33)

""Bullying"" as understood by Reddit admins apparently includes upvoting certain wrong thinking content, so if you upvote anything like that, you will be banned. 

&gt;[If you 'shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse' you will be banned. ](https://archive.is/PYJtg#selection-225.108-225.173)

(Except if you shut potentially millions of Trump supporters out of the conversation, of course. Try posting at almost anywhere all over Reddit as a Trump supporter, and tell me how it goes.)

&gt;[""Directing unwanted invective at someone"" - will get you banned.](https://archive.is/PYJtg#selection-225.256-225.295)

Not sure invective is ever wanted but okay. 

&gt;[""Directing abuse at a person or group"" will get you banned. ](https://archive.is/PYJtg#selection-229.118-229.154)

Don't you ever think to say anything offensive about the Democrat party. It will be considered 'abuse' as Reddit administrators understand the term and you will be banned. Of course this includes upvoting content that is deemed 'abusive'.

P.S.: I'm not saying don't stay on Reddit. I'm still here too. But if you stay, understand what the rules are as of today, and not the ones you think you know from many years before. Those are gone and are never coming back, Reddit was a completely different place back then.",,,

Unfortunately, candidates need to go through our regular vetting process in which we learn their age, location, experience, reason for wanting to moderate, as well as putting them through a voice interview, which is then followed by extensive training. We cannot hand anyone the keys to The Donald without taking these important steps.

That's not to say we cannot bring on any of the admin-approved candidates, if they are extremely well vetted, but they would need to go through our standard procedure. As an important political community, moderators must be selected and vetted incredibly carefully. Any forced additions of unvetted moderators is unacceptable within political communities.

We have additionally requested ongoing communication with the Reddit team. We have made this request numerous times in past months, but are hopeful that this time they will be open to it.

With this communication, we hope to get forewarning about situations such as the White House whistleblower, before they become final warnings with ""further consequences"" impending.

Taking this step is hugely important in demonstrating that Reddit is serious about wanting to host conservatives on their platform during this election season.

Finally, we're unfortunately stuck in restricted mode for the time being. Our most active moderators were all removed in the purge - and our bots, and it's simply not justifiable to reopen without having the moderators to do so.",,,

Through the long days and exhausting nights of non-stop updooting, with no sign of that glorious message in my inbox, I had begun to lose hope that my efforts would be recognized.  But still, I persevered, turning those arrows orange until my thumb joints ached and my eyes burned.  And then, finally, gloriously - the message came!  The Reddit Admins have at last recognized my non-stop efforts to promote wrongthink.  I’m truly honored to know that I, a humble pede, am at last acknowledged by those at the top.

But no man is an island and I couldn’t have done this alone.  I’d like to thank Spez for being such a massive, massive cuck.  Indeed, I find it difficult to fully express the sheer magnitude of his cuckery and to adequately put into words his capacity to bend over and spread his cheeks for the collective dick of the Chinese Communist Party.  So, I shall simply thank you, Spez, for your unparalleled faggotry.

I’d also like to thank the collective target audience of Reddit - the soyboys, the feminists, the LGBTQIIAMAPFGNSTGZC, the Bernouts, the Biden sniffers, the Tulsi grabbers, the Bloomborgs, all of you.  Without the tireless efforts you put into being perpetually triggered and falling for every 4Chan hoax, none of this would have been possible.  You may not know what gender you are at any given moment, but you know how to be outraged.

And how could I forget the humble memesmiths and sommemeliers of The_Donald?  Slaving away day-in and day-out to handcraft only the spiciest memes for our enjoyment?  Without you, there would be no Wrongthink and nothing to updoot.  I raise a special orange arrow to you all.  Of course, I can’t leave this paragraph without an honorable mention to the leftists, socialists and just general Democrats - it’s your complete, abject stupidity in the face of rationality and logic which makes this all possible.

On a personal note, a shout-out to Seth Rich and Jeffrey Epstein for their accomplishments in the field of not killing themselves.  You guys are an inspiration to us all.

Thank you all for everything you’ve done to aid my journey.  I hope my story inspires others to aim for the moon because, even if you miss, you’ll end up in the Reddit gulag!",,,

the_donald,Hey Commie Reddit Admins,"The\_Donald ""only"" has almost 800k subs. You know how many votes Trump got in 2016? Over 60 million.

This year? It's only going to be even higher. Much higher.

You think gestapo'ing our sub out from under us is going to change anything? How dumb are you guys? Honest question. We, our total subs that is, account for like a bit over 1/70th of the total votes of the 2016 election. Even if your commie wrongthink thought camp ""reeducated"" all of us (LUL JK we're going to [thedonald.win](https://thedonald.win), and are still all voting for GEOTUS this year, eat shit reddit commie scum), you'll barely have made a dent.

In fact, you'll bring more of us to vote for Trump, just like every time you liberal commie scum does some dumb stunt like this, because moderates and people on the fence realize you're turning full fucking commie-nazi-thought-police and they know that's not what America is about.

Donald J Trump is going to be your president for another 4 years, all the members of the Donald, pre-commie take over, will move on just fine with their lives, while you'll all be here crying through your nose rings trying to figure out why you can't win anything. This is America you retarded commie fucks, land of the free, and your communist ideals will never prevail here.

And since the first bit of censorship years ago, T\_D patriots have spent every waking moment dining in Hell.

But now, we're free. We've not only won the battles, but we've ultimately won the war.

No matter what they did, Spez and his band of leftist counterparts couldn't squash us, censor us, or discredit us. No matter how badly we were hit, we not only were never out of the fight, but we grew even stronger with each blow.

The only way Reddit admins could stop us is to make T\_D not T\_D -- and even still, it's far too late.

The damage has been done. The world better understands the accomplishments of the president, the moral bankruptcy of progressivism, and just how incredible Trump's fan-base really is.

The call for new moderators is suppose to close tomorrow 2/27. At that time the reddit admins will install their own leftist mods, and boot the patriot mods.

I believe their plan for this is to turn T_D into a trap. It will have posts that give lukewarm praise to our amazing president (to keep up appearance), but will be flooded with commenters that criticize GEOTUS. They will say things like ""This isn't what I voted for"", and ""Why is he doing this, he's betraying us.""

Even simple logic will prove these people wrong, but it won't matter. The prey for this trap are people that are wishy washy on who to vote for, and are looking around. These people probably don't read much past the headlines, and are looking for a group that will pat them on the back for following along.

This is election interference. Plain and simple. It will be more effective than $100,000 of facebook ads, or however many ads they claimed they bought during the muh russia hoax.",,,

If there is one thing I cannot stand it is the crying ultra left fuckers. Don’t do it. We are above that. We control the country Trump is the man to beat (not gonna happen). Do not get involved in this shit. Smile. Tell your Bernie supporting neighbor to have a great day every day and hope that they can come to shine in the sun with us one day.,,,

Basically, I can take any picture/video and modify it in a certain way such that it looks indistinguishable to you but appears drastically different to the computer. So much so that the computer cannot run any face detection/classification algorithms on it.

Do you think such tech might be useful? Any way I can make this better? What are the down side? Any general thoughts?

There have been at least [two](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-are-gnawing-at-the-foundations-of-americas-free-and-fair-elections/2021/06/13/3f40ffa0-cacd-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html) WaPo [op-eds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/09/without-these-changes-us-democracy-will-remain-vulnerable-trump-other-bad-actors/) raising the prospect.  Bill Maher warned darkly on his HBO show of a ""slow moving coup"" and got a fair bit of attention for it elsewhere in the media, including [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/media/donald-trump-slow-moving-coup/index.html)

Okay, I'm convinced: alarm successfully raised!  But what I really want to understand is the nuts and bolts or ""tick tock"" of exactly how this would play out.  All the reading and Googling I have done have failed to dispel the murkiness.  I'm hoping there are Constitutional law experts here, or at least attorneys familiar with election law, who can shed some light.

I have the sense that these officials or legislatures would declare the state won by Trump even if the actual votes were greater for the Democratic nominee.  Would they change the popular vote tallies or just declare them irrelevant, stating that they have the authority to choose electors regardless of who wins the ""beauty contest"" or ""straw poll""?  I have some sense there is ambiguity in the Constitution as to whether this is allowed, but I imagine the Supreme Court will weigh in and Roberts might defect but they would be likely to get five votes supporting the Republican side.

Would it be [like 1876?](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/disputed-election-1876)  

&gt;Republicans and Democrats rushed to those three states to watch and try to influence the counting of the votes. The returning boards determined which votes to count and could throw out votes, if they deemed them fraudulent. The returning boards in all three states argued that fraud, intimidation, and violence in certain districts invalidated votes, and they threw out enough Democratic votes for Hayes to win.

That sounds an awful lot like what is being predicted.  But in that case multiple slates of electors showed up to cast votes, which I guess wouldn't happen now due to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which makes the 1876 experience less relevant as a precedent, since it was designed to clarify issues that came up there.

But this Act is one of the things these editorialists have warned needs to be updated, and reading the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Act) about it I was unable to come up with clarity on how this would play out.  Does it pretty much come down to a state's governor and who they say won the state's electoral votes?  Yesterday's results are even more disturbing in that case, given that those are two states Democrats will sorely need in their column in the presidential election.  But hopefully Republican governors wouldn't endorse an alternate electoral slate if the popular vote wasn't even close?  Hopefully?

Still, there's an ominous quote in that Wiki article from the execrable Bush v. Gore decision:

&gt;""\[T\]he state legislature's power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by state legislatures in several States for many years after the framing of our Constitution...The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors.""

If they got five votes for that decision in 2000, there's no way we'd get five votes overturning it now.",Opinion,44.75,11.5

Hi, I have recently been trying to compile times throughout United States history where an issue had a specific view that we can look back on today and agree/know it was wrong. I have tried using google but I get flooded with click-bait articles that have nothing to do with what I am looking for.

The only example I will give is that we can clearly look back on the choice to abolish slavery and agree it was the right decision. At the time there were obviously people that disagreed but now there is a definite consensus among reasonable people, across the entire population, that keeping slavery would be wrong and abolishing it was the correct thing to do. (Yes, the choice to Declare Independence from Great Britain is also, but that was the establishing of our country, I am interested in things that we have had to deal with since then.)

This is the only example (or 2 I guess) I will give in order to minimize skewing and let you all be creative. The issue certainly does not have to be that old, it can be at any time, as long as it has been significantly settled that one view was wrong (I can think of possible examples as recent as within the last decade.)

We will be calling confirmed CalCare supporters who haven't signed the supporter petition yet.

CalCare aka AB1400 will be debated in the CA Assembly in January.  The deadline to pass this bill is January 31.  We need to get as much popular support as possible.  Last time, 5 years ago, the Senate passed it but it got killed in the Assembly.  This time, we started it in the Assembly, because that is the harder nut to crack.  Dist 02 Assemblyman, Jim Wood, has stated that he is willing to debate whatever healthcare bill comes up in his Assembly Health Committee, which he chairs.  

The goal of the phone bank is to remind known supporters to sign the petition in support of CalCare, and urge people to call their Assemblyperson, which will most likely be Jim Wood.  All the phone numbers that the dialer app calls will be in District 2.

democrats,No the reconciliation bill and BBB at large are not basically nothing,"The bill has been released for less than a few hours and already our more extreme members are asking their favorite politicians to tank this bill. Before we get into hysterics, let's take a look at what's actually in this bill.

#Childcare

##Universal and free preschool for all 3 and 4 year olds.

Self-explanatory.

##Expanded Child Tax credit ($3600 total, $300 per month) to 39 million households. 

Don't let this one slide as many of the detractor's of Biden's admin have repeatedly acknowledged the good it does, but paired it with the phrase ""but it won't last until the end of the year, so it doesn't matter!"" showing their extreme privilege.

#Climate

##Rebates and tax credits for families switching to clean energy. 

This one lowers the installation cost of Solar by 30%, reducing the payback time by 5 years, and offers a 12,500 credit on EVs made in the US. Don't keep pushing this ""Manchin is doing nothing for the environment"", he may be from Coal Capital US, but he's helping get the right thing gets done whether people see it or not.

##Helps create new jobs in producing Wind and Solar power.

A simple investment plan here, but helps reduce the cost of these two more by evading tariffs and import costs.

##A new climate board (300,000+ members), and a focus on public transportation.

Cleaner trucks and buses = cleaner cities = a cleaner world.

##Agriculture restoration.

Helps farmers to restore coasts, forests, and soil ravaged by Climate Change. This means better food and more carbon heat-sinks.

#Healthcare pls

##Gladly! The ACA is now stronger, and premiums have been reduced!

Premiums reduced by $600 per person, per year for 9 million Americans. Roughly 3 million uninsured Americans will now have affordable access

##Medicaid gap, begone!

$0 premiums are now available for up to 4 million uninsured Americans.

##Medicare now covers hearing

I shouldn't have to repeat it, but if I do, and you're 65 and older, congrats! Go get those hearing aides, you earned 'em!

#Buff the Middle Class

##Housing? Yes In My BackYard!

Construction, rehab, and improvement to 1 million affordable homes. This outta help everyone out.

##More tax credits!

Extends the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for roughly 17million low-wage workers by more than$1,100. This will help pull people out of poverty even if the make above minimum wage.

#Education

##Post High-school education

Pell Grants are now increased by $550 for more than 5 million students and also include DREAMers. It also invests in historically black colleges/universities, and tribal colleges/universities. Finally, annual spending for the Labor Department's workforce development will increase by 50% for the next 5 years.

##School Meals

Free school meals expanded to 8.7 million children and a monthly payment of $65 per child per month to families of 29 million children to help provide food when school is not in session.

##Immigration

A separate $100 billion in immigration reform alone is included. This will help clean the backlog, expand the legal representation, and make it easier for those seeking asylum.

#But how's it paid for?

##Minimum corporate tax

Now every single corporation that reports $1 billion in profits to it's shareholders must pay a minimum 15% tax on those profits (150,000,000 for 1 $1 billion corporation). Additionally a 1% buyback on corporate stocks is attached.

##Fleeing American taxes? Not so fast!

Biden has made a deal with 136 other countries to impose a global 15% minimum tax. Countries that fail to abide receive a penalty.

##Pay up!

An additional 5% rate to those with income above 10 million, and 3% more to those making 25 million. Watch out Bernie, millionaires are included in this one.

##A hint towards a newer, more powerful IRS

Not included, but Biden plans to revitalize the IRS to make them the stuff of nightmares for those who evade their taxes. Watch out Yoshi!

democrats,A simple response for those on the left who tell you not to vote for Democrats If you know of a political party who has achieved more good and made more progress for the American people in the past century than the Democrats have then vote for that party instead This is largely a rhetorical argument as it immediately puts the bothsider on the side of opposing progress and makes it clear that not voting for or actively voting against Democrats is counterproductive to their purported goals  Or drop the word counterprogressive and watch them squirm    The point of this argument is multifold      First it reminds readers of the practical real life progress the Democratic party has accomplished    Second juxtaposing it as then vote for that other party reminds the readers of who the other party in this country is and how little they have done for us    Third it puts the bothsider in the hot seat as now theyre being asked to propose a solution that achieves more progress than voting for Americas most progressive party    It sort of yanks the discussion out of the hypothetical and grounds it back in reality and history    You can snark your reply up a bit with this handydandy adlib    Okay so vote for the other party that      created Medicare Medicaid and Social Security    gave 20 million Americans health insurance in 2009    joined then later rejoined the Paris Climate Accords    forgave more than 15 billion in student debt in 2021    passed civil union and marriage equality laws in their states    dramatically increased fuel economy standards for consumer vehicles    outlawed preexisting conditions and insurance gender cost disparities    established the federal minimum wage and raised it 21 out of 23 times    wrote passed and signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act    Et cetera and youve got all the way back to FDR to pull from for examples the point is to tailor the argument to your audience    There is obviously a much longer deeper discussion to be had about why not voting is literally the dumbest thing that any politically minded human being can do this post was more made to explain how to shut the conversation down before its spores have a chance to set root in uninoculated readers brains  If you want to go down the rabbit hole youre more than welcome but Ive found that the act of arguing with these people tends to give their argument more credence than they deserve,"This is largely a rhetorical argument, as it immediately puts the both-sider on the side of opposing progress, and makes it clear that not voting for, or actively voting against Democrats is counterproductive to their purported goals.  (Or drop the word counterprogressive and watch them squirm.)  
  
The point of this argument is multifold:  
  
 * First it reminds readers of the practical, real life progress the Democratic party has accomplished.  
 * Second, juxtaposing it as ""then vote for that *other* party"" reminds the readers of who the *other* party in this country is, and how little they have done for us.  
 * Third, it puts the both-sider in the hot seat, as now they're being asked to propose a solution that *achieves more progress* than voting for America's most progressive party.  
  
It sort of yanks the discussion out of the hypothetical and grounds it back in reality and history.  
  
You can snark your reply up a bit with this handy-dandy ad-lib:  
  
""Okay, so vote for the *other party* that...  
  
 * ...created Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.""  
 * ...gave 20 million Americans health insurance in 2009.""  
 * ...joined, then later re-joined the Paris Climate Accords.""  
 * ...forgave more than $1.5 billion in student debt in 2021.""  
 * ...passed civil union and marriage equality laws in their states.""  
 * ...dramatically increased fuel economy standards for consumer vehicles.""  
 * ...outlawed pre-existing conditions and insurance gender cost disparities.""  
 * ...established the federal minimum wage and raised it 21 out of 23 times.""  
 * ...wrote, passed, and signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.""  
  
Et cetera, and you've got all the way back to FDR to pull from for examples, the point is to tailor the argument to your audience.  
  
There is, obviously, a much longer, deeper discussion to be had about why not voting is literally the dumbest thing that any politically minded human being can do, this post was more made to explain how to shut the conversation down before its spores have a chance to set root in uninoculated readers' brains.

That's your right to be a selfish piece of shit. But why do they insist on calling everything Biden does ""tyranny"" and oppression and comparing it to Nazi Germany? In Nazi Germany, some things that happened were a)Forcibly relocating Jews to ghettos b)Forcibly transporting Jews to death camps with horrific living conditions c)Murdering Jews with toxic gas, d)Murdering people with disabilities with toxic gas, e)Committing widespread human experimentation, and many more, but what I've listed is enough. But comparing this to anything Biden has done? Shut up and stop minimizing a horrific human tragedy because you wish Trump won.

Here are some relevant questions: Is Biden deploying the Federal Marshals to round up all Trump supporters? Is he nationalizing the economy and seizing private property? Is he calling for a genocide against White people? Is he calling for physical violence against Republicans (remember, Republicans wanted to hang a sitting vice president)? Is he forcing Critical Race Theory that teaches ""White people are demonic""  to be taught in all schools? Unless I've missed something, the answer to all of the above is no.

Is it completely impossible for Republican voters to think critically about anything? Come on now, use your brain and stop acting like a 5 year old with the constant anger. If you don't like it, leave. Eastern Europe has tons of far right groups for you to join. ",,-197.51,106.6

democrats,clear GOP poll bias,"I just got an ad for an official poll on the GOP website. The ad was clearly targeted and the poll was as biased as possible. Oh yeah and their sample size for the whole of the U.S. was 250 participants. This just shows how little they care about collecting actual , unbiased data, by sending polls to their own supporters and making it clear which option they want the poll takers to choose in order to get the numbers they want.

democrats,The Relationship between scientists and political affiliation TLDR 6 of scientists are Republican 55 Democrat 32 independent,"Hi, I was wondering what the relationship was between scientists and their political affiliation in the US. 

Unfortunately I could not find any recent information or research however I did find a poll in 2009.  ""Pew Research Center Poll from July 2009 showed that only around [6 percent](http://people-press.org/report/528/) of U.S. scientists are Republicans; 55 percent are Democrats, 32 percent are independent, and the rest “don’t know” their affiliation.""

(This text was taken from: [https://slate.com/technology/2010/12/most-scientists-in-this-country-are-democrats-that-s-a-problem.html](https://slate.com/technology/2010/12/most-scientists-in-this-country-are-democrats-that-s-a-problem.html) )

Before looking into it (just through google i didn't ""research"" it but the answer appears clear from those who have) I thought there may be a bias here however this is incredible! I cannot believe how insane this is really. Of course the figures may have changed over the years but the likelihood of it showing a nicer light on the Republican mind set in this day and age is unlikely IMO.

I do wonder what a sensible Republican may make of this. 

I am certain a none sensible Republican would likely use this as evidence of the BIG CONSPIRACIES somehow but at least I found this very interesting. A more objective look rather than just assuming.

Or am I being a silly sausage and this was so obvious and already known to everyone else. Sorry if that is the case people.

They watch Fox, OAN and Newsmax almost all day. Confederate flag in the front yard, the whole thing... 

As I've gotten older (Mid 30s now) I've gotten more liberal. They raised me to care about people and now that I do they call me a ""socialist libtard...""

I just can't agree with some of the things my dad in particular believes... Just to give an example, he legitimately believes Michelle Obama is a man named Michael LeVon Robinson... Like... He honestly believes this to be true. 

Today I'm at his house watching football and my dad is scrolling Facebook. He finds something about gas prices and starts going off about Biden and OPEC, and how our country is doomed and China will own us in three years...

My dad asked me, ""tell me one good thing Biden has done.""

So I said ""Sure, as soon as you can tell me one good thing Trump did.""

He rattled off all the talking points like closing the border, leaving the World Health Organization, lowering gas prices and unemployment, a strong economy... 

I pointed out that Trump inherited low unemployment and a strengthening economy from Obama... He said it was bullshit, so I asked my dad to tell me what specific policies led to all of Trump's successes.

And he angrily yelled ""I don't give a fuck about Trump! I'm asking you to tell me what Biden has done and you can't do it!"" Like... Spittle was coming from his mouth.

I didn't answer immediately because I was shocked at how angry and aggressive the conversation had gotten in an instant.

For the past four plus years, any time Trump was criticized for something, my dad would immediately blame Obama... He would talk about how Obama messed the country up and how Trump is fixing it...

But now I'm not allowed ask about Trump?

Suddenly comparisons and contrasts aren't allowed in conversations?

Then he told me I'm fucked in the head, and I fired back that he's ""sexist, racist and homophobic, but I'M the one fucked in the head? Yeah, ok.""

That was pretty much the end of the conversation.

Really put a damper on the football game we were watching together...

I love my dad very much, but any time politics comes up he turns into an unrecognizable person. Since an injury made him retire from work, all he does is sit in front of the TV and watch the ""news,"" and I hate what it's done to him.

Not really any greater point to this post. I guess I'm just sad at what's happened to my parents.",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,-365.32,175.3

I’m sure many will disagree and downvote this, but since Climate Change is an existential global threat I believe Democrats should put everything else down and get clean energy done first at any cost. If there was a way we could make it happen by sacrificing social spending or even infrastructure, it would be worth it in the long run.

Think about it. The Earth is irreplaceable and no one is going to save us if we fail to change how we use and produce energy. In a way, focusing so much on our immediate social needs (which are great) could be threatening the lives of our children and future generations.

Get climate change legislation done. Everything else is literally a short-term issue.

Under the Texas abortion law, if an Uber driver can be sued for aiding an abortion, shouldn’t Abbott qualify to be sued for any miscarriage that occurs in Texas?

Here’s the premise:

1. Abbott, as a devout Christian, believes God answers prayer.  

2. When Abbott prays “thy will be done” instead of “please end all miscarriages”, he is allowing these miscarriages to happen by not asking God to intervene (at least, if he actually believes in the “power of prayer”).

3. Abbott, by permitting God to “do his will” even when it results in miscarriages (God-caused abortions) is as responsible for this aborted pregnancy as any bystander currently liable under the law.

The GOP always said training is the key to curbing gun violence, these suggestions put that idea to the test.

1. Mandatory gun training for every student beginning in Pre-K through 12th.

- Pre-school would focus on gun safety, gun are not toys, every gun is loaded, if you see a gun tell an adult, etc… Second Amendment memorized 
- Middle would still be very heavy on gun safety, but safe gun handling would be introduced by trained experts (Army, Marine, Guard). Gun wound first aid will be introduced. Second Amendment discuss.
- High-school would still be about gun safety, gun handling, and gun care. Under strict supervision, students will regularly fire handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Gun wound first aid will be reinforced through simulated practice. Second Amendment studied and debated. 

By the end of this, you will have an entire generation of Americans trained and educated about guns.

2. Allow citizens to complete the paperwork necessary to own guns as part of their drivers license process

3. Encourage Americans to own guns through a stimulus payment

4. Repeal open carry laws

5. Provide resources for establishing community militias 

This basically arms and organizes  minorities, which should m gun nuts more open to:

6. Make no knock warrants completely illegal in the name of officer safety

7. Require every gun owner attend an annual refresher of their senior year training.

8.Require criminal background checks

9. Law Enforcement cannot carry, use, or modify any weapon not available to the general public

10. All guns will be classed as civilian or military use, law enforcement will only be able to use civilian classed weapons.

11. Gun owners must complete a mental health survey annually, and a mental health screening every 5-years until the age of 65, from that point forward the screening is annual

democrats,Dear Republicans Killing yourself is a really lousy way to own the libs so Ive listed some ways you cant own us if youre dead in hopes that youll reconsider your stance on vaccinations If owning the libs is your goal there are better ways to do it I call myself a bleeding heart liberal because I care about people and seeing people letting themselves die to own the libs is not my idea of a good time  Now if youre a conservative you may think thats the ultimate own  gtThey want to give me universal health care so the best way to own them is by letting myself catch a deadly disease  But heres the thing While that is admittedly a very BIG own its also short sighted  Youre focusing on a short term windfall at the expense of long term potential   Why own us just once by dying when by surviving you can own us many times for decades to come    Getting inoculated against COVID and taking sensible steps to minimize exposure will give you many many more opportunities to own me than dying does and with that in mind Ive compiled a small list of ways you wont be able to own me if youre dead  This list is not all inclusive there are a number of ways that Ive left off simply for fear of getting carried away but its a reasonable place to start        If youre dead there will be nobody to burn their Nikes when an athlete kneels or destroy their Keurigs when they stop buying ads during Hannity  If youre dead you cant elect people to require women have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound in order to get family planning services  If youre dead there will be nobody to defend the second amendment against common sense research reforms and regulations  The delta variant proves evolution is real by getting vaccinated you can pretend that the delta variant is fake  If youre dead there will be nobody to stop the libs outlawing Christianity heterosexuality andor Whiteness    If youre dead you cant scream at members of the school board for teaching critical race theory  If youre dead real America gets weaker while us cosmopolitan globalist liberals get stronger    If you die before Hillary Clinton does you officially get counted as one of her murder victims    If youre dead youll never get to see President Obamas long form Kenyan birth certificate    If youre dead you cant protest at abortion clinics and the funerals of dead soldiers  Osama Bin Laden wanted you to die  Youre not Osama Bin Laden are you  Without you the oil and coal industries are doomed to failure  If you die nobody will remember American history anymore    If youre dead you lose the war on Christmas    Dying to a preventable disease is socialism  If you die the bisexual agenda wins    If you die you cant own the libs      If you dear conservative really want to get under my skin Ive got news for you You cant do it from the grave  The very best way to own the libs is by surviving in fact its the only way to own the libs at least the only way to own us more than once        s okay  This was all meant to be tongue in cheek but only a little bit if I thought these arguments or arguments like them could get our countrymen into their doctors office Id be screaming those arguments from the rooftops but I fear that my encouragement would only inspire them to double down on denialism    It just sucks you know  Im a liberal because I give a shit about people even the assholes so seeing people almost literally killing themselves just so that they can make a political statement hurts  The fact that the statement theyre making is based on propaganda and lies only makes it worse    I had to block HCA I couldnt handle it it was too much for me  I want this to be over,"I call myself a bleeding heart liberal because I care about people, and seeing people letting themselves die to own the libs is *not* my idea of a good time.  Now if you're a conservative you may think that's the ultimate own:  

&gt;""They want to give me universal health care, so the best way to own them is by letting myself catch a deadly disease!""
  
But here's the thing: While that is, admittedly, a very **BIG** own, it's also short sighted.  You're focusing on a short term windfall at the expense of long term potential.   Why own us just once by *dying,* when by *surviving* you can own us *many times* for *decades* to come?  
  
Getting inoculated against COVID and taking sensible steps to minimize exposure will give you many, many more opportunities to own me than dying does, and with that in mind I've compiled a small list of ways you won't be able to own me if you're dead.  This list is not all inclusive, there are a number of ways that I've left off simply for fear of getting carried away, but it's a reasonable place to start.  

---  
---  
  
If you're dead there will be nobody to burn their Nikes when an athlete kneels, or destroy their Keurigs when they stop buying ads during Hannity.  

If you're dead you can't elect people to require women have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound in order to get family planning services.  

If you're dead there will be nobody to defend the second amendment against common sense research, reforms, and regulations.  

The delta variant proves evolution is real, by getting vaccinated you can pretend that the delta variant is fake.  

If you're dead there will be nobody to stop the libs outlawing Christianity, heterosexuality, and/or Whiteness.  
  
If you're dead you can't scream at members of the school board for teaching critical race theory.  

If you're dead ""real America"" gets weaker while us cosmopolitan globalist liberals get stronger.    

If you die before Hillary Clinton does you officially get counted as one of her murder victims.  
  
If you're dead you'll never get to see President Obama's long form Kenyan birth certificate.  
  
If you're dead you can't protest at abortion clinics and the funerals of dead soldiers.  

Osama Bin Laden wanted you to die.  You're not Osama Bin Laden, are you?  

Without you the oil and coal industries are doomed to failure.  

If you die nobody will remember American history anymore.    

If you're dead you lose the war on Christmas.  
  
Dying to a preventable disease is socialism.  

If you die the bisexual agenda wins.  
  
If you die you ***can't own the libs.***
  
---  
---  

If you, dear conservative, really want to get under my skin, I've got news for you: You can't do it from the grave.  The very best way to own the libs is by surviving, in fact it's the *only* way to own the libs, at least the only way to own us more than once.  
  
---  
  
/s, okay?  This was all meant to be tongue in cheek, but only a little bit; if I thought these arguments, or arguments like them, could get our countrymen into their doctor's office, I'd be screaming those arguments from the rooftops, but I fear that my encouragement would only inspire them to double down on denialism.  
  
It just sucks, you know?  I'm a liberal because I give a shit about people, even the assholes, so seeing people almost literally killing themselves just so that they can make a political statement hurts.  The fact that the statement they're making is based on propaganda and lies only makes it worse.

I, like many others in this thread, have become increasingly VERY anti Trumpian over the past 4 years. Quite frankly, I loathe trump supporters and everything they stand for. I live in the most liberal state in the country - Massachusetts. However, the majority of the cops I know on the department I’m in the process of joining are staunch trump supporters. I also know that a few officers on the department already know that I’m a liberal. I just had my orientation at the department and I saw 2 separate walls in different offices dedicated to Trump, as well as multiple “DeSantis 2024” bumper stickers on filing cabinets. 

I have a good career lined up that I spent 4 years going to college to prepare for (bachelors degree in criminal justice). I always wanted to be a cop just like my dad was (it’s the same department he worked for for 34 years). I can make a good living and hopefully make a positive difference in the community. My question is - with the current political climate - should I consider an alternate career route? I’m not very outspoken in public settings when it comes to politics, but I do get irritated when people express unwarranted political views just to make conversation. I know I can definitely keep my mouth shut, seeing as I’ll be outnumbered and I don’t want my peers to hate me just because of my political views. Are there any democratic police officers that could give me a few pointers? With me getting on the department becoming more of a reality, the fear of whether I’ll fit in or whether the job is even right for me with it now being SUCH a pro trump profession has been weighing heavily on my mind causing me to get anxiety and rethink the entire thing. Any pointers in general would be appreciated. Thank you!",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,-260.1,132.8

Job growth has been stunted by the Delta variant. Seven-day average new cases dropped below 100,000 for the first time in months yesterday. Meanwhile, 95 percent of Americans over 65, 79 percent over 18, and 77 percent over 12 have gotten the first dose of the vaccine; we are on track to get the Moderna vaccine fully approved for adults and the Pfizer vaccine given emergency use for kids five to 11 in the next few weeks.  At this rate, we'll far surpass critical mass by the end of the year, and CDC and NIH officials believe this wave was the last major wave the U.S. will experience. 

The debt ceiling and legislative battles on Capitol Hill have also played a factor. The debt ceiling has been raised until December, and we will have the bipartisan and reconciliation infrastructure bills done within a month.

Meanwhile, just today, a historic global minimum tax agreement was reached.

At the current rate of 550,000 jobs a month, we should restore our nation's economy by September 2022, much faster than our recovery from the 2008 recession.",:snoo_putback: Opinion,-128.15,82.1

Aside from a few Democrats scolding them for it, I’m not seeing any sign that the left is taking it seriously, and they should.

The right was humiliated in their 2020 presidential loss and the fallout they received for the insurrection. It’s clear they’re building a system that will ensure they win the next election and possibly all proceeding elections, yet this party is just standing on the sidelines watching. WHY!?

Say what you will about conservatives, but if the tables were flipped and it was the dems doing this the Republicans would make it a hot button issue and would hammer it home to their voter base that they are clearly rigging the system, but the dems just seem to let it happen right under their nose.

What’s going on here?

https://newrepublic.com/article/160951/republican-plot-rig-2024-election",Question :snoo_thoughtful:,71.14,7.6
democrats,Would it be possible to unseat Utah Sen Mike Lee next year,"I just read that [Evan McMullin announced an independent bid for Senate](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/05/evan-mcmullin-utah-senate-bid-515129) in Utah next year. 

A little background: McMullin, an outspoken Never Trumper, received 21.5% of the Presidential vote in 2016, just behind Hillary Clinton’s 27.5%. Together, the two of them received nearly half of the vote, several percentage points _more_ than Trump did. At the time, McMullin wasn’t seriously trying to become president (his was more of a protest candidacy), but now things look different.

If the Utah electorate hasn’t changed significantly since then, this implies it might be possible to unseat Lee _if_ McMullin’s supporters and the Democrats agree to throw their support behind a single candidate (i.e. whoever is ahead in the polls before voting starts). That’s a big _if_ (McMullin and whomever the Democrats nominate would have to be close enough politically for one to consider endorsing the other at all). But it’s still a scenario worth considering, seeing as how every Senate seat matters in what is likely to be a close battle for control. “Off the beaten path” states like Utah could well end up playing a decisive role.",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,84.68,4.4

We're effectively a single party state.  We want opposition, but the national party refuses to try here.  We haven't had too many credible candidates for statewide office in the last 20 years.  We effectively do not have free and fair elections, as they're pretty well rigged for the Republican party at this point.

We *need* investment from the national party.  We need the party to send us personnel.  We need the party to help us identify and train candidates.  We need the party to help us train leadership.

But we won't get it.  We're looking to throw away yet another election cycle here because we're too busy infighting over the fact that we're not growing like we thought we would--that the state's demographic shifts haven't produced any turn away from the good old boy politics that have kept us here.

Biden has the cajones to get us out of the Middle East.  He literally ended a 20 years long, unwinnable war.  Over 2400 American soldiers died, as well as another 3000 American contractors. All anyone can talk about, even Democrats are the last 13 who died due to a suicide bomber.  While it WAS terrible, How does that totally overshadow ending a war?    Sitting here 3 weeks after the withdrawal, we got 130,000 people out, Most every American who wants out is out. Yes, it took two weeks longer than it should.

Every Republican is yelling about spending 3.5 trillion.  That is over 10 years. or 350 billion a year.  LESS THAN 1/2 OF WHAT WE SPEND ON DEFENSE.  Why isn't every Democrat asking McCarthy why he isn't willing to spend 1/2 of what we spend on defense on helping Americans, on infrastructure, on childcare so more people can get back to work?!?  But not a word.

Biden's child tax credit gives poor kids money so they are no longer in poverty.  Someone mentioned that Biden cut childhood poverty by almost 1/2 in another post and there were dozens of replies asking WTF they were talking about.   

New information comes out about how Trump  had many approaches to taking the presidency back even though he lost the vote, including having legally cast votes disallowed allowing Pence to ""anoint"" him president again.  And their side believe Biden was the one who cheated.

I could list another 10 points but you understand.   Why are we so bad at this and what can be done.

Fortunately their childishness has a very simple ""off"" switch...as soon as the $3.5 Trillion infrastructure package is passed, hold an immediate vote on the CLEAN debt ceiling increase.  Clean..no amendments, no triggers..just a simple Bill that raises the debt ceiling to whatever's deemed appropriate.

*If Republicans are smart* they'll do nothing and let it pass (they can always whine on OAN/Fox later after all, etc.)

**If Republicans are stupid enough to tie themselves to the debt ceiling...which is EXACTLY what they'll be doing if they filibuster it...then the President of the United States should go on National Television and tell both the country and the world that this economic calamity will only be averted by Republicans either dropping their filibuster or 10 Republicans crossing over and voting for cloture.**

AND USE THE WORD ""cloture"".

*Don't allow Republicans to turn this into a facebook meme fight...use BIG words and make Republicans look like idiots if they don't understand them.  Make it clear that a CLEAN debt ceiling increase can be had in a 60 second vote and ONLY Republicans ""refusal to vote for cloture"" is stopping it.*

*Again...hammer it home over and over and over...""Republicans refuse to vote for cloture!"", ""Republicans refuse to vote for cloture""!...people won't have a clue what ""cloture"" is, but they'll know Republicans are refusing to vote for it and that is what's threatening the country, etc.*

I've seen many long-winded posts here and elsewhere about how Republicans win and this folks *IS* how they win...they turn everything into a single line they can repeat over and over and over and over.",:snoo_putback: Opinion,-257.05,131.6

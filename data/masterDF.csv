Basically, I can take any picture/video and modify it in a certain way such that it looks indistinguishable to you but appears drastically different to the computer. So much so that the computer cannot run any face detection/classification algorithms on it.

Do you think such tech might be useful? Any way I can make this better? What are the down side? Any general thoughts?

There have been at least [two](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-are-gnawing-at-the-foundations-of-americas-free-and-fair-elections/2021/06/13/3f40ffa0-cacd-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html) WaPo [op-eds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/09/without-these-changes-us-democracy-will-remain-vulnerable-trump-other-bad-actors/) raising the prospect.  Bill Maher warned darkly on his HBO show of a ""slow moving coup"" and got a fair bit of attention for it elsewhere in the media, including [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/media/donald-trump-slow-moving-coup/index.html)

Okay, I'm convinced: alarm successfully raised!  But what I really want to understand is the nuts and bolts or ""tick tock"" of exactly how this would play out.  All the reading and Googling I have done have failed to dispel the murkiness.  I'm hoping there are Constitutional law experts here, or at least attorneys familiar with election law, who can shed some light.

I have the sense that these officials or legislatures would declare the state won by Trump even if the actual votes were greater for the Democratic nominee.  Would they change the popular vote tallies or just declare them irrelevant, stating that they have the authority to choose electors regardless of who wins the ""beauty contest"" or ""straw poll""?  I have some sense there is ambiguity in the Constitution as to whether this is allowed, but I imagine the Supreme Court will weigh in and Roberts might defect but they would be likely to get five votes supporting the Republican side.

Would it be [like 1876?](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/disputed-election-1876)  

&gt;Republicans and Democrats rushed to those three states to watch and try to influence the counting of the votes. The returning boards determined which votes to count and could throw out votes, if they deemed them fraudulent. The returning boards in all three states argued that fraud, intimidation, and violence in certain districts invalidated votes, and they threw out enough Democratic votes for Hayes to win.

That sounds an awful lot like what is being predicted.  But in that case multiple slates of electors showed up to cast votes, which I guess wouldn't happen now due to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which makes the 1876 experience less relevant as a precedent, since it was designed to clarify issues that came up there.

But this Act is one of the things these editorialists have warned needs to be updated, and reading the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Act) about it I was unable to come up with clarity on how this would play out.  Does it pretty much come down to a state's governor and who they say won the state's electoral votes?  Yesterday's results are even more disturbing in that case, given that those are two states Democrats will sorely need in their column in the presidential election.  But hopefully Republican governors wouldn't endorse an alternate electoral slate if the popular vote wasn't even close?  Hopefully?

Still, there's an ominous quote in that Wiki article from the execrable Bush v. Gore decision:

&gt;""\[T\]he state legislature's power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by state legislatures in several States for many years after the framing of our Constitution...The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors.""

If they got five votes for that decision in 2000, there's no way we'd get five votes overturning it now.",Opinion,44.75,11.5

Hi, I have recently been trying to compile times throughout United States history where an issue had a specific view that we can look back on today and agree/know it was wrong. I have tried using google but I get flooded with click-bait articles that have nothing to do with what I am looking for.

The only example I will give is that we can clearly look back on the choice to abolish slavery and agree it was the right decision. At the time there were obviously people that disagreed but now there is a definite consensus among reasonable people, across the entire population, that keeping slavery would be wrong and abolishing it was the correct thing to do. (Yes, the choice to Declare Independence from Great Britain is also, but that was the establishing of our country, I am interested in things that we have had to deal with since then.)

This is the only example (or 2 I guess) I will give in order to minimize skewing and let you all be creative. The issue certainly does not have to be that old, it can be at any time, as long as it has been significantly settled that one view was wrong (I can think of possible examples as recent as within the last decade.)

We will be calling confirmed CalCare supporters who haven't signed the supporter petition yet.

CalCare aka AB1400 will be debated in the CA Assembly in January.  The deadline to pass this bill is January 31.  We need to get as much popular support as possible.  Last time, 5 years ago, the Senate passed it but it got killed in the Assembly.  This time, we started it in the Assembly, because that is the harder nut to crack.  Dist 02 Assemblyman, Jim Wood, has stated that he is willing to debate whatever healthcare bill comes up in his Assembly Health Committee, which he chairs.  

The goal of the phone bank is to remind known supporters to sign the petition in support of CalCare, and urge people to call their Assemblyperson, which will most likely be Jim Wood.  All the phone numbers that the dialer app calls will be in District 2.

democrats,No the reconciliation bill and BBB at large are not basically nothing,"The bill has been released for less than a few hours and already our more extreme members are asking their favorite politicians to tank this bill. Before we get into hysterics, let's take a look at what's actually in this bill.

#Childcare

##Universal and free preschool for all 3 and 4 year olds.

Self-explanatory.

##Expanded Child Tax credit ($3600 total, $300 per month) to 39 million households. 

Don't let this one slide as many of the detractor's of Biden's admin have repeatedly acknowledged the good it does, but paired it with the phrase ""but it won't last until the end of the year, so it doesn't matter!"" showing their extreme privilege.

#Climate

##Rebates and tax credits for families switching to clean energy. 

This one lowers the installation cost of Solar by 30%, reducing the payback time by 5 years, and offers a 12,500 credit on EVs made in the US. Don't keep pushing this ""Manchin is doing nothing for the environment"", he may be from Coal Capital US, but he's helping get the right thing gets done whether people see it or not.

##Helps create new jobs in producing Wind and Solar power.

A simple investment plan here, but helps reduce the cost of these two more by evading tariffs and import costs.

##A new climate board (300,000+ members), and a focus on public transportation.

Cleaner trucks and buses = cleaner cities = a cleaner world.

##Agriculture restoration.

Helps farmers to restore coasts, forests, and soil ravaged by Climate Change. This means better food and more carbon heat-sinks.

#Healthcare pls

##Gladly! The ACA is now stronger, and premiums have been reduced!

Premiums reduced by $600 per person, per year for 9 million Americans. Roughly 3 million uninsured Americans will now have affordable access

##Medicaid gap, begone!

$0 premiums are now available for up to 4 million uninsured Americans.

##Medicare now covers hearing

I shouldn't have to repeat it, but if I do, and you're 65 and older, congrats! Go get those hearing aides, you earned 'em!

#Buff the Middle Class

##Housing? Yes In My BackYard!

Construction, rehab, and improvement to 1 million affordable homes. This outta help everyone out.

##More tax credits!

Extends the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for roughly 17million low-wage workers by more than$1,100. This will help pull people out of poverty even if the make above minimum wage.

#Education

##Post High-school education

Pell Grants are now increased by $550 for more than 5 million students and also include DREAMers. It also invests in historically black colleges/universities, and tribal colleges/universities. Finally, annual spending for the Labor Department's workforce development will increase by 50% for the next 5 years.

##School Meals

Free school meals expanded to 8.7 million children and a monthly payment of $65 per child per month to families of 29 million children to help provide food when school is not in session.

##Immigration

A separate $100 billion in immigration reform alone is included. This will help clean the backlog, expand the legal representation, and make it easier for those seeking asylum.

#But how's it paid for?

##Minimum corporate tax

Now every single corporation that reports $1 billion in profits to it's shareholders must pay a minimum 15% tax on those profits (150,000,000 for 1 $1 billion corporation). Additionally a 1% buyback on corporate stocks is attached.

##Fleeing American taxes? Not so fast!

Biden has made a deal with 136 other countries to impose a global 15% minimum tax. Countries that fail to abide receive a penalty.

##Pay up!

An additional 5% rate to those with income above 10 million, and 3% more to those making 25 million. Watch out Bernie, millionaires are included in this one.

##A hint towards a newer, more powerful IRS

Not included, but Biden plans to revitalize the IRS to make them the stuff of nightmares for those who evade their taxes. Watch out Yoshi!

democrats,A simple response for those on the left who tell you not to vote for Democrats If you know of a political party who has achieved more good and made more progress for the American people in the past century than the Democrats have then vote for that party instead This is largely a rhetorical argument as it immediately puts the bothsider on the side of opposing progress and makes it clear that not voting for or actively voting against Democrats is counterproductive to their purported goals  Or drop the word counterprogressive and watch them squirm    The point of this argument is multifold      First it reminds readers of the practical real life progress the Democratic party has accomplished    Second juxtaposing it as then vote for that other party reminds the readers of who the other party in this country is and how little they have done for us    Third it puts the bothsider in the hot seat as now theyre being asked to propose a solution that achieves more progress than voting for Americas most progressive party    It sort of yanks the discussion out of the hypothetical and grounds it back in reality and history    You can snark your reply up a bit with this handydandy adlib    Okay so vote for the other party that      created Medicare Medicaid and Social Security    gave 20 million Americans health insurance in 2009    joined then later rejoined the Paris Climate Accords    forgave more than 15 billion in student debt in 2021    passed civil union and marriage equality laws in their states    dramatically increased fuel economy standards for consumer vehicles    outlawed preexisting conditions and insurance gender cost disparities    established the federal minimum wage and raised it 21 out of 23 times    wrote passed and signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act    Et cetera and youve got all the way back to FDR to pull from for examples the point is to tailor the argument to your audience    There is obviously a much longer deeper discussion to be had about why not voting is literally the dumbest thing that any politically minded human being can do this post was more made to explain how to shut the conversation down before its spores have a chance to set root in uninoculated readers brains  If you want to go down the rabbit hole youre more than welcome but Ive found that the act of arguing with these people tends to give their argument more credence than they deserve,"This is largely a rhetorical argument, as it immediately puts the both-sider on the side of opposing progress, and makes it clear that not voting for, or actively voting against Democrats is counterproductive to their purported goals.  (Or drop the word counterprogressive and watch them squirm.)  
  
The point of this argument is multifold:  
  
 * First it reminds readers of the practical, real life progress the Democratic party has accomplished.  
 * Second, juxtaposing it as ""then vote for that *other* party"" reminds the readers of who the *other* party in this country is, and how little they have done for us.  
 * Third, it puts the both-sider in the hot seat, as now they're being asked to propose a solution that *achieves more progress* than voting for America's most progressive party.  
  
It sort of yanks the discussion out of the hypothetical and grounds it back in reality and history.  
  
You can snark your reply up a bit with this handy-dandy ad-lib:  
  
""Okay, so vote for the *other party* that...  
  
 * ...created Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.""  
 * ...gave 20 million Americans health insurance in 2009.""  
 * ...joined, then later re-joined the Paris Climate Accords.""  
 * ...forgave more than $1.5 billion in student debt in 2021.""  
 * ...passed civil union and marriage equality laws in their states.""  
 * ...dramatically increased fuel economy standards for consumer vehicles.""  
 * ...outlawed pre-existing conditions and insurance gender cost disparities.""  
 * ...established the federal minimum wage and raised it 21 out of 23 times.""  
 * ...wrote, passed, and signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.""  
  
Et cetera, and you've got all the way back to FDR to pull from for examples, the point is to tailor the argument to your audience.  
  
There is, obviously, a much longer, deeper discussion to be had about why not voting is literally the dumbest thing that any politically minded human being can do, this post was more made to explain how to shut the conversation down before its spores have a chance to set root in uninoculated readers' brains.

That's your right to be a selfish piece of shit. But why do they insist on calling everything Biden does ""tyranny"" and oppression and comparing it to Nazi Germany? In Nazi Germany, some things that happened were a)Forcibly relocating Jews to ghettos b)Forcibly transporting Jews to death camps with horrific living conditions c)Murdering Jews with toxic gas, d)Murdering people with disabilities with toxic gas, e)Committing widespread human experimentation, and many more, but what I've listed is enough. But comparing this to anything Biden has done? Shut up and stop minimizing a horrific human tragedy because you wish Trump won.

Here are some relevant questions: Is Biden deploying the Federal Marshals to round up all Trump supporters? Is he nationalizing the economy and seizing private property? Is he calling for a genocide against White people? Is he calling for physical violence against Republicans (remember, Republicans wanted to hang a sitting vice president)? Is he forcing Critical Race Theory that teaches ""White people are demonic""  to be taught in all schools? Unless I've missed something, the answer to all of the above is no.

Is it completely impossible for Republican voters to think critically about anything? Come on now, use your brain and stop acting like a 5 year old with the constant anger. If you don't like it, leave. Eastern Europe has tons of far right groups for you to join. ",,-197.51,106.6

democrats,clear GOP poll bias,"I just got an ad for an official poll on the GOP website. The ad was clearly targeted and the poll was as biased as possible. Oh yeah and their sample size for the whole of the U.S. was 250 participants. This just shows how little they care about collecting actual , unbiased data, by sending polls to their own supporters and making it clear which option they want the poll takers to choose in order to get the numbers they want.

democrats,The Relationship between scientists and political affiliation TLDR 6 of scientists are Republican 55 Democrat 32 independent,"Hi, I was wondering what the relationship was between scientists and their political affiliation in the US. 

Unfortunately I could not find any recent information or research however I did find a poll in 2009.  ""Pew Research Center Poll from July 2009 showed that only around [6 percent](http://people-press.org/report/528/) of U.S. scientists are Republicans; 55 percent are Democrats, 32 percent are independent, and the rest “don’t know” their affiliation.""

(This text was taken from: [https://slate.com/technology/2010/12/most-scientists-in-this-country-are-democrats-that-s-a-problem.html](https://slate.com/technology/2010/12/most-scientists-in-this-country-are-democrats-that-s-a-problem.html) )

Before looking into it (just through google i didn't ""research"" it but the answer appears clear from those who have) I thought there may be a bias here however this is incredible! I cannot believe how insane this is really. Of course the figures may have changed over the years but the likelihood of it showing a nicer light on the Republican mind set in this day and age is unlikely IMO.

I do wonder what a sensible Republican may make of this. 

I am certain a none sensible Republican would likely use this as evidence of the BIG CONSPIRACIES somehow but at least I found this very interesting. A more objective look rather than just assuming.

Or am I being a silly sausage and this was so obvious and already known to everyone else. Sorry if that is the case people.

They watch Fox, OAN and Newsmax almost all day. Confederate flag in the front yard, the whole thing... 

As I've gotten older (Mid 30s now) I've gotten more liberal. They raised me to care about people and now that I do they call me a ""socialist libtard...""

I just can't agree with some of the things my dad in particular believes... Just to give an example, he legitimately believes Michelle Obama is a man named Michael LeVon Robinson... Like... He honestly believes this to be true. 

Today I'm at his house watching football and my dad is scrolling Facebook. He finds something about gas prices and starts going off about Biden and OPEC, and how our country is doomed and China will own us in three years...

My dad asked me, ""tell me one good thing Biden has done.""

So I said ""Sure, as soon as you can tell me one good thing Trump did.""

He rattled off all the talking points like closing the border, leaving the World Health Organization, lowering gas prices and unemployment, a strong economy... 

I pointed out that Trump inherited low unemployment and a strengthening economy from Obama... He said it was bullshit, so I asked my dad to tell me what specific policies led to all of Trump's successes.

And he angrily yelled ""I don't give a fuck about Trump! I'm asking you to tell me what Biden has done and you can't do it!"" Like... Spittle was coming from his mouth.

I didn't answer immediately because I was shocked at how angry and aggressive the conversation had gotten in an instant.

For the past four plus years, any time Trump was criticized for something, my dad would immediately blame Obama... He would talk about how Obama messed the country up and how Trump is fixing it...

But now I'm not allowed ask about Trump?

Suddenly comparisons and contrasts aren't allowed in conversations?

Then he told me I'm fucked in the head, and I fired back that he's ""sexist, racist and homophobic, but I'M the one fucked in the head? Yeah, ok.""

That was pretty much the end of the conversation.

Really put a damper on the football game we were watching together...

I love my dad very much, but any time politics comes up he turns into an unrecognizable person. Since an injury made him retire from work, all he does is sit in front of the TV and watch the ""news,"" and I hate what it's done to him.

Not really any greater point to this post. I guess I'm just sad at what's happened to my parents.",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,-365.32,175.3

I’m sure many will disagree and downvote this, but since Climate Change is an existential global threat I believe Democrats should put everything else down and get clean energy done first at any cost. If there was a way we could make it happen by sacrificing social spending or even infrastructure, it would be worth it in the long run.

Think about it. The Earth is irreplaceable and no one is going to save us if we fail to change how we use and produce energy. In a way, focusing so much on our immediate social needs (which are great) could be threatening the lives of our children and future generations.

Get climate change legislation done. Everything else is literally a short-term issue.

Under the Texas abortion law, if an Uber driver can be sued for aiding an abortion, shouldn’t Abbott qualify to be sued for any miscarriage that occurs in Texas?

Here’s the premise:

1. Abbott, as a devout Christian, believes God answers prayer.  

2. When Abbott prays “thy will be done” instead of “please end all miscarriages”, he is allowing these miscarriages to happen by not asking God to intervene (at least, if he actually believes in the “power of prayer”).

3. Abbott, by permitting God to “do his will” even when it results in miscarriages (God-caused abortions) is as responsible for this aborted pregnancy as any bystander currently liable under the law.

The GOP always said training is the key to curbing gun violence, these suggestions put that idea to the test.

1. Mandatory gun training for every student beginning in Pre-K through 12th.

- Pre-school would focus on gun safety, gun are not toys, every gun is loaded, if you see a gun tell an adult, etc… Second Amendment memorized 
- Middle would still be very heavy on gun safety, but safe gun handling would be introduced by trained experts (Army, Marine, Guard). Gun wound first aid will be introduced. Second Amendment discuss.
- High-school would still be about gun safety, gun handling, and gun care. Under strict supervision, students will regularly fire handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Gun wound first aid will be reinforced through simulated practice. Second Amendment studied and debated. 

By the end of this, you will have an entire generation of Americans trained and educated about guns.

2. Allow citizens to complete the paperwork necessary to own guns as part of their drivers license process

3. Encourage Americans to own guns through a stimulus payment

4. Repeal open carry laws

5. Provide resources for establishing community militias 

This basically arms and organizes  minorities, which should m gun nuts more open to:

6. Make no knock warrants completely illegal in the name of officer safety

7. Require every gun owner attend an annual refresher of their senior year training.

8.Require criminal background checks

9. Law Enforcement cannot carry, use, or modify any weapon not available to the general public

10. All guns will be classed as civilian or military use, law enforcement will only be able to use civilian classed weapons.

11. Gun owners must complete a mental health survey annually, and a mental health screening every 5-years until the age of 65, from that point forward the screening is annual

democrats,Dear Republicans Killing yourself is a really lousy way to own the libs so Ive listed some ways you cant own us if youre dead in hopes that youll reconsider your stance on vaccinations If owning the libs is your goal there are better ways to do it I call myself a bleeding heart liberal because I care about people and seeing people letting themselves die to own the libs is not my idea of a good time  Now if youre a conservative you may think thats the ultimate own  gtThey want to give me universal health care so the best way to own them is by letting myself catch a deadly disease  But heres the thing While that is admittedly a very BIG own its also short sighted  Youre focusing on a short term windfall at the expense of long term potential   Why own us just once by dying when by surviving you can own us many times for decades to come    Getting inoculated against COVID and taking sensible steps to minimize exposure will give you many many more opportunities to own me than dying does and with that in mind Ive compiled a small list of ways you wont be able to own me if youre dead  This list is not all inclusive there are a number of ways that Ive left off simply for fear of getting carried away but its a reasonable place to start        If youre dead there will be nobody to burn their Nikes when an athlete kneels or destroy their Keurigs when they stop buying ads during Hannity  If youre dead you cant elect people to require women have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound in order to get family planning services  If youre dead there will be nobody to defend the second amendment against common sense research reforms and regulations  The delta variant proves evolution is real by getting vaccinated you can pretend that the delta variant is fake  If youre dead there will be nobody to stop the libs outlawing Christianity heterosexuality andor Whiteness    If youre dead you cant scream at members of the school board for teaching critical race theory  If youre dead real America gets weaker while us cosmopolitan globalist liberals get stronger    If you die before Hillary Clinton does you officially get counted as one of her murder victims    If youre dead youll never get to see President Obamas long form Kenyan birth certificate    If youre dead you cant protest at abortion clinics and the funerals of dead soldiers  Osama Bin Laden wanted you to die  Youre not Osama Bin Laden are you  Without you the oil and coal industries are doomed to failure  If you die nobody will remember American history anymore    If youre dead you lose the war on Christmas    Dying to a preventable disease is socialism  If you die the bisexual agenda wins    If you die you cant own the libs      If you dear conservative really want to get under my skin Ive got news for you You cant do it from the grave  The very best way to own the libs is by surviving in fact its the only way to own the libs at least the only way to own us more than once        s okay  This was all meant to be tongue in cheek but only a little bit if I thought these arguments or arguments like them could get our countrymen into their doctors office Id be screaming those arguments from the rooftops but I fear that my encouragement would only inspire them to double down on denialism    It just sucks you know  Im a liberal because I give a shit about people even the assholes so seeing people almost literally killing themselves just so that they can make a political statement hurts  The fact that the statement theyre making is based on propaganda and lies only makes it worse    I had to block HCA I couldnt handle it it was too much for me  I want this to be over,"I call myself a bleeding heart liberal because I care about people, and seeing people letting themselves die to own the libs is *not* my idea of a good time.  Now if you're a conservative you may think that's the ultimate own:  

&gt;""They want to give me universal health care, so the best way to own them is by letting myself catch a deadly disease!""
  
But here's the thing: While that is, admittedly, a very **BIG** own, it's also short sighted.  You're focusing on a short term windfall at the expense of long term potential.   Why own us just once by *dying,* when by *surviving* you can own us *many times* for *decades* to come?  
  
Getting inoculated against COVID and taking sensible steps to minimize exposure will give you many, many more opportunities to own me than dying does, and with that in mind I've compiled a small list of ways you won't be able to own me if you're dead.  This list is not all inclusive, there are a number of ways that I've left off simply for fear of getting carried away, but it's a reasonable place to start.  

---  
---  
  
If you're dead there will be nobody to burn their Nikes when an athlete kneels, or destroy their Keurigs when they stop buying ads during Hannity.  

If you're dead you can't elect people to require women have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound in order to get family planning services.  

If you're dead there will be nobody to defend the second amendment against common sense research, reforms, and regulations.  

The delta variant proves evolution is real, by getting vaccinated you can pretend that the delta variant is fake.  

If you're dead there will be nobody to stop the libs outlawing Christianity, heterosexuality, and/or Whiteness.  
  
If you're dead you can't scream at members of the school board for teaching critical race theory.  

If you're dead ""real America"" gets weaker while us cosmopolitan globalist liberals get stronger.    

If you die before Hillary Clinton does you officially get counted as one of her murder victims.  
  
If you're dead you'll never get to see President Obama's long form Kenyan birth certificate.  
  
If you're dead you can't protest at abortion clinics and the funerals of dead soldiers.  

Osama Bin Laden wanted you to die.  You're not Osama Bin Laden, are you?  

Without you the oil and coal industries are doomed to failure.  

If you die nobody will remember American history anymore.    

If you're dead you lose the war on Christmas.  
  
Dying to a preventable disease is socialism.  

If you die the bisexual agenda wins.  
  
If you die you ***can't own the libs.***
  
---  
---  

If you, dear conservative, really want to get under my skin, I've got news for you: You can't do it from the grave.  The very best way to own the libs is by surviving, in fact it's the *only* way to own the libs, at least the only way to own us more than once.  
  
---  
  
/s, okay?  This was all meant to be tongue in cheek, but only a little bit; if I thought these arguments, or arguments like them, could get our countrymen into their doctor's office, I'd be screaming those arguments from the rooftops, but I fear that my encouragement would only inspire them to double down on denialism.  
  
It just sucks, you know?  I'm a liberal because I give a shit about people, even the assholes, so seeing people almost literally killing themselves just so that they can make a political statement hurts.  The fact that the statement they're making is based on propaganda and lies only makes it worse.

I, like many others in this thread, have become increasingly VERY anti Trumpian over the past 4 years. Quite frankly, I loathe trump supporters and everything they stand for. I live in the most liberal state in the country - Massachusetts. However, the majority of the cops I know on the department I’m in the process of joining are staunch trump supporters. I also know that a few officers on the department already know that I’m a liberal. I just had my orientation at the department and I saw 2 separate walls in different offices dedicated to Trump, as well as multiple “DeSantis 2024” bumper stickers on filing cabinets. 

I have a good career lined up that I spent 4 years going to college to prepare for (bachelors degree in criminal justice). I always wanted to be a cop just like my dad was (it’s the same department he worked for for 34 years). I can make a good living and hopefully make a positive difference in the community. My question is - with the current political climate - should I consider an alternate career route? I’m not very outspoken in public settings when it comes to politics, but I do get irritated when people express unwarranted political views just to make conversation. I know I can definitely keep my mouth shut, seeing as I’ll be outnumbered and I don’t want my peers to hate me just because of my political views. Are there any democratic police officers that could give me a few pointers? With me getting on the department becoming more of a reality, the fear of whether I’ll fit in or whether the job is even right for me with it now being SUCH a pro trump profession has been weighing heavily on my mind causing me to get anxiety and rethink the entire thing. Any pointers in general would be appreciated. Thank you!",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,-260.1,132.8

Job growth has been stunted by the Delta variant. Seven-day average new cases dropped below 100,000 for the first time in months yesterday. Meanwhile, 95 percent of Americans over 65, 79 percent over 18, and 77 percent over 12 have gotten the first dose of the vaccine; we are on track to get the Moderna vaccine fully approved for adults and the Pfizer vaccine given emergency use for kids five to 11 in the next few weeks.  At this rate, we'll far surpass critical mass by the end of the year, and CDC and NIH officials believe this wave was the last major wave the U.S. will experience. 

The debt ceiling and legislative battles on Capitol Hill have also played a factor. The debt ceiling has been raised until December, and we will have the bipartisan and reconciliation infrastructure bills done within a month.

Meanwhile, just today, a historic global minimum tax agreement was reached.

At the current rate of 550,000 jobs a month, we should restore our nation's economy by September 2022, much faster than our recovery from the 2008 recession.",:snoo_putback: Opinion,-128.15,82.1

Aside from a few Democrats scolding them for it, I’m not seeing any sign that the left is taking it seriously, and they should.

The right was humiliated in their 2020 presidential loss and the fallout they received for the insurrection. It’s clear they’re building a system that will ensure they win the next election and possibly all proceeding elections, yet this party is just standing on the sidelines watching. WHY!?

Say what you will about conservatives, but if the tables were flipped and it was the dems doing this the Republicans would make it a hot button issue and would hammer it home to their voter base that they are clearly rigging the system, but the dems just seem to let it happen right under their nose.

What’s going on here?

https://newrepublic.com/article/160951/republican-plot-rig-2024-election",Question :snoo_thoughtful:,71.14,7.6
democrats,Would it be possible to unseat Utah Sen Mike Lee next year,"I just read that [Evan McMullin announced an independent bid for Senate](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/05/evan-mcmullin-utah-senate-bid-515129) in Utah next year. 

A little background: McMullin, an outspoken Never Trumper, received 21.5% of the Presidential vote in 2016, just behind Hillary Clinton’s 27.5%. Together, the two of them received nearly half of the vote, several percentage points _more_ than Trump did. At the time, McMullin wasn’t seriously trying to become president (his was more of a protest candidacy), but now things look different.

If the Utah electorate hasn’t changed significantly since then, this implies it might be possible to unseat Lee _if_ McMullin’s supporters and the Democrats agree to throw their support behind a single candidate (i.e. whoever is ahead in the polls before voting starts). That’s a big _if_ (McMullin and whomever the Democrats nominate would have to be close enough politically for one to consider endorsing the other at all). But it’s still a scenario worth considering, seeing as how every Senate seat matters in what is likely to be a close battle for control. “Off the beaten path” states like Utah could well end up playing a decisive role.",:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,84.68,4.4

We're effectively a single party state.  We want opposition, but the national party refuses to try here.  We haven't had too many credible candidates for statewide office in the last 20 years.  We effectively do not have free and fair elections, as they're pretty well rigged for the Republican party at this point.

We *need* investment from the national party.  We need the party to send us personnel.  We need the party to help us identify and train candidates.  We need the party to help us train leadership.

But we won't get it.  We're looking to throw away yet another election cycle here because we're too busy infighting over the fact that we're not growing like we thought we would--that the state's demographic shifts haven't produced any turn away from the good old boy politics that have kept us here.

Biden has the cajones to get us out of the Middle East.  He literally ended a 20 years long, unwinnable war.  Over 2400 American soldiers died, as well as another 3000 American contractors. All anyone can talk about, even Democrats are the last 13 who died due to a suicide bomber.  While it WAS terrible, How does that totally overshadow ending a war?    Sitting here 3 weeks after the withdrawal, we got 130,000 people out, Most every American who wants out is out. Yes, it took two weeks longer than it should.

Every Republican is yelling about spending 3.5 trillion.  That is over 10 years. or 350 billion a year.  LESS THAN 1/2 OF WHAT WE SPEND ON DEFENSE.  Why isn't every Democrat asking McCarthy why he isn't willing to spend 1/2 of what we spend on defense on helping Americans, on infrastructure, on childcare so more people can get back to work?!?  But not a word.

Biden's child tax credit gives poor kids money so they are no longer in poverty.  Someone mentioned that Biden cut childhood poverty by almost 1/2 in another post and there were dozens of replies asking WTF they were talking about.   

New information comes out about how Trump  had many approaches to taking the presidency back even though he lost the vote, including having legally cast votes disallowed allowing Pence to ""anoint"" him president again.  And their side believe Biden was the one who cheated.

I could list another 10 points but you understand.   Why are we so bad at this and what can be done.

Fortunately their childishness has a very simple ""off"" switch...as soon as the $3.5 Trillion infrastructure package is passed, hold an immediate vote on the CLEAN debt ceiling increase.  Clean..no amendments, no triggers..just a simple Bill that raises the debt ceiling to whatever's deemed appropriate.

*If Republicans are smart* they'll do nothing and let it pass (they can always whine on OAN/Fox later after all, etc.)

**If Republicans are stupid enough to tie themselves to the debt ceiling...which is EXACTLY what they'll be doing if they filibuster it...then the President of the United States should go on National Television and tell both the country and the world that this economic calamity will only be averted by Republicans either dropping their filibuster or 10 Republicans crossing over and voting for cloture.**

AND USE THE WORD ""cloture"".

*Don't allow Republicans to turn this into a facebook meme fight...use BIG words and make Republicans look like idiots if they don't understand them.  Make it clear that a CLEAN debt ceiling increase can be had in a 60 second vote and ONLY Republicans ""refusal to vote for cloture"" is stopping it.*

*Again...hammer it home over and over and over...""Republicans refuse to vote for cloture!"", ""Republicans refuse to vote for cloture""!...people won't have a clue what ""cloture"" is, but they'll know Republicans are refusing to vote for it and that is what's threatening the country, etc.*

I've seen many long-winded posts here and elsewhere about how Republicans win and this folks *IS* how they win...they turn everything into a single line they can repeat over and over and over and over.",:snoo_putback: Opinion,-257.05,131.6

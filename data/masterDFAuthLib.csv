I'm going to sound like such a larper here, but...

&amp;#x200B;

We should not, under no pretext or circumstances, make any sort of ""peace"" with the progfash. No progfash moderators alongside traditionalists. We have to stand tall against the progfash. No compromise. I would rather get banned for the 14th time and make a new account, which takes all but about 30 seconds, than compromise with the vermin we swore to protect our families against. Like why are we even worried about getting banned anyway? It's going to happen sooner or later. It always happens. It will happen again. Ironically, in Reddit's pursuit of a free speech haven they ban anyone who disagrees with their anarcho-libertarian horseshit. Yes, it is unfortunate we have the Reddit ""yikes sweetie"" faggot gestapo invading our sovereign promised land, but their posts meant to make this worse are unironically correct. LGBT issues, ESPECIALLY the T part, are some of the most anti-traditionalist rhetoric I have heard. It does not matter whether or not you support a plethora of other ideas, you are progressive on one of the largest issues that affects Authoritarians. We do not support you. We do not want you. Make your own subreddit if you want, but stay out of mine.

First of all, I want to apologize for putting this off for so long. I was not, and am still not sure of the best way to handle this situation. 

This subreddit has experienced a lot of growth recently, and with that growth a few rather controversial problems. It definitely needs more moderating but the issue is figuring out how to moderate.

My philosophy with this subreddit has always been a lax approach and letting the users and Reddit's voting system determine what content is good. However, we can all tell that it's not working that well.

I am not an expert on authoritarian theory, nor am I an authoritarian. I am probably the least qualified person here. I have received upwards of 30-40 messages from people asking to be mod and making their cases, so I couldn't just randomly pick some because it wouldn't be the best for the subreddit.

With that being said, I'm not sure how to choose more mods. Voting sounds rather unauthoritarian, so I'm just going to try my best to choose 3-4 people who are representative of the community as a whole and have them make the decisions. 

If you would like to become a mod, or if you would like someone else to become a mod, leave a comment below with some reasons why you should be mod. You can also leave a comment if you have suggestions for the subreddit. I will be disregarding all previous messages as there are simply too many and it wouldn't be fair to consider only some.

TL;DR: If you want to be mod now's your chance",,,

So, here I present to you my solution which I bet neither side will like but you gotta make due with what you have.

Progs will remove things like ""homo"", ""trans"", etc, etc from their flairs and in return at least two trads mentioned on this [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Authoritarianism/comments/kkmdfo/i_made_this_and_yes_im_playing_both_sides_so_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) will make a frogfashwave. Obviously both sides will stop memeing eachother.

It actually saddens me to see that the only solution you could see is creating a separate sub and discord..

I am still (and probably always) a socially conservative, economically leftist, total authoritarian. I have been some brand of authoritarian for most of my (albeit short) life, natsoc, natsynd, class fash, and I have believed in the &gt;muh return to trad and &gt;muh degens for most of it, even successfully converting many in my life to follow this third position. 

But all this time I knew something was missing, because my lived experience in my country is that it does not have a history, or a tradition, and is what I would call a Synthetic nation-state; one not formed from a rooted people tied to their land as you Europeans or Mainland Chinese do, or formed through armed struggle for the sake of liberty as you Americans were. And seeing the modern condition, aren't we all? 

Your histories and traditions commodified through rampant capitalism post WW2, perverted through the lenses of neo-cons, neo-libs and the mainstream consciousness to fit whatever agenda they want to push. 

The usual heroes of us auths like daddy A, uncle B M, or even uncle Corneliu for you clerical fash had all not only failed, but cannibalised and were cannibalised by the very auths they swore to arms with, and were historically, a massive failure for the Auth movement. 

I would say that we are haunted by the ghosts of lost futures, imagining for a future that already left, based on a past that never really existed. 

To illustrate this, when natsocs want a return to tradition, which one? The wheat fields and agricultural lifestyle which, frankly, never existed in any sustainable capacity? And even if it were, it is simply not one that is feasible in our current historical circumstance. 

When we talk about returning to the values of old, which one? If we were to live as our forefathers did, and embody their traditions, then we would have to concede and commit horrible acts of violence as well. Back when we had the idealised nuclear family, domestic abuse was frequent and rampant, and even for the misogynistic auths out there, you have to concede that the nuclear family cannot function to its full potential when there is such a dysfunction as domestic abuse. So clearly when auths (in good faith) claim for a ""return to tradition"", is it really a tradition we want to return to, or an idealised past that we made for ourselves?

But what is our modern malaise? A global economic system that deterritorializes, schizophrenises and nullifies meaning, technological progression that is a zero sum game for humanity as a whole, and a great societal anterograde amnesia and depression caused by a lack of meaning, while capital itself uses and exploits trite differences through identity politics to further atomise and antagonise the peoples of our nations. We are facing a radically different reality than our forefathers ever did, with material conditions the likes of which were never seen before.

The point I'm making is that we have come to a point in history that has entirely severed us from our past, and that for a coherent, reasonable authoritarian force for now and the future, a radical reflection must be done, one that is materialist, one that is frank and honest with itself, and one that is not afraid to leap forward without looking back. And until such a ""new authoritarianism"" can exist, there simply is no political label that I can wear. 

If anyone else is interested in such a discussion, or even a traditional critique of what I've said, feel free to comment or PM me. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",,,

Authoritarianism,Heres a break from the war Lets talk about Yockey,"For those of you who have read *Imperium* by a Francis Parker Yockey, known for being a lawyer for the Nuremburg Trials (who obviously didn't agree with it) until he left, got arrested, and imprisoned; then ""suiciding himself"". For the less refined like me, he's the ""haha funi gamer"" president in a HOI4 mod.

I got his book for Christmas because he interested me a great deal, and his views are definitely very esoteric and a little wack at times. I read through the front pages of the book before getting into the meat of it (the publishing company had a sonnenrad printed beneath their info, very nice) and his chapter titles were both interesting and funny as hell. ""Cultural Retardation as a form of Cultural Distortion"". ""The Negro in America"". ""The Abyss"". It's funny because I don't know how the fuck he got away with it. It was dedicated to the Hero of Europe. Sounds like our favorite Argentinian Uncle to me. ;)

Anyways, enough talk about the front and onto the 45 or so pages I read for today. It was all about Yockey's view of history and what lens to view it through. He discussed ""supercultures"", i.e. those of China, the Ancient Aegean, Islam, the Pre-Columbian, and Europe. Their rise and fall, and how all cultures have a lifetime and go through a cycle, all very Hegelian but with a proper, *spiritual* outlook instead of merely materialistic. He, in fact, goes on to criticize materialism and the common western view that history is progress, which is simply not true. Everything that rises must fall and be replaced, eventually. 

My favorite quote from all of this is one Yockey definitely wanted the reader to remember, seeing as he italicized it. ""History is the relationship between the Past and Present"". It's such a simple statement of fact that we all subconsciously know, but Yockey has seemed to present it in a conscious way that makes sense. He actually goes on to view how we view history, and adds to the quote ""history is written by the victors"" to ""history changes due to the current conditions"", perhaps hinting at how the conditions in 1948, do not need to view an Uncle A as good now, but perhaps, sometime soon... he will be.

My only criticism is HOW he writes. He's very eccentric like his inspiration and needs editorial work, and often uses larger words that I think could be broken up at times, and sometimes he'll jump around a bit. I'll get used to it as time goes on!

Let me know if you want me to make this a series, or if you don't like it I take it down. I also have Spengler's *Decline of the West* I can discuss too. But, most importantly, **let me know what you think!** I posted this here to discuss with you all. 

And, as a P.S., I resign from this cursed war. I would rather not have degeneracy in my ranks but I would also rather not side with AHS. I offer an olive branch in friendship.

And the traditionalists just want their nation to be conservative, what others do in their own homeland is degenerative but of no business to them, right?

Unless I’ve gotten that wrong, really seems like there could be peace here. At the end of the day, you’re still hoping for a stronger, authoritarian state to rule the people. When that days comes, you guys wouldn’t have to be neighbors. Both of your ideal states are opposites of one another, thus you can both have your own progressive nations or conservative nations and they never have to interact with each other. Just my thoughts, curious as to how you all see it.",,,

Our biggest problem is that r/authoritarianism doesn't feels like r/FULLTOTALITARIAN, It should be more like its ancestor.

Here are some of the steps I think we should take to make it like that:
1. Have an actual logo and a banner to give it more life
2. Have r/NazbolFemboy or r/PrettyFlyforAnonBi to be moderators (if they agree)
3. Have a strict anti bigotry rule, ban anyone posting bigoted posts or comments, if we want to preserve this space we must follow this rule
4. Lastly, make this sub private forever, we can invite people who are authoritarian via r/politicalcompass by looking at their results.

Again:⚠️DO NOT INVITE RACISTS⚠️, this sub is intended for discussion of authoritarian political theory and memes, this is not your safe space for being a bigot.",,,

I’m more specifically a voluntarist or an anarcho-capitalist. One thing to note about my ideology is that given property rights, communities would be totally allowed to form with any political/economic model they want, as long as it is voluntary and is not decided on by force. You can have authoritarian and fascist communities, communist or socialist places, theocratic states, ethnostates, whatever it is that you want.

I'll likely  graph everything myself and make an updated post sometime later this  week for anyone interested so I can include all of the information  instead of only the most common answers. That said, 55 people here took  the census, so I'm providing a breakdown of a big chunk of the info  until I finish everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The  majority of this sub is zoomers or younger millennials. 56.4 % of  respondents are between the ages of 13-17, 38.2% are between 18-24. We  have 2 people here between 25-29, and one person who responded is 35-39.

&amp;#x200B;

The  United States is by far the country with the most people from this  subreddit, making up 40% or 22 people. Next was the United Kingdom with  4. Turkey, Serbia, Poland, Italy, and China had 2 each. We also had one  person each from Sweden, Slovenia, Russia, Romania, Portugal,  Netherlands, Malaysia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Latvia, Ireland, India,  Hungary, Estonia, Croatia, Canada, and Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost  everyone here is white. Most respondents didn’t expand beyond that but  most of those who did defined themselves as Slavic, Aryan, Anglo, or  European (and a handful of people simply put one of those four with  nothing else), though there were a handful of other responses. We also  have one person who is mostly white with some African and Native  American. Non White responses include Han Chinese (2), Turkic (2), Hindu  (2), Arab (1), Middle Eastern (1), Hispanic (1). We only had one person  say the gamer word, so congrats lads.

&amp;#x200B;

Unsurprisingly  it’s a sausagefest here. 50 of us are male (90.9%) and we have one  person who chose female. We also had one response each in the “other”  field for trans woman, agender, femboy, and genderless.

&amp;#x200B;

This  sub is almost 75% heterosexual (technically over 75% if we’re counting  the “normal” and “heterosexual+asexual” responses). Bisexual was the  next most common at 9% with 5 people. Beyond that we have Homosexual  (2), Androsexual (1), Asexual (2), Unsure (2)

&amp;#x200B;

Most  of us are religious (70.7% overall), and half of the total responders  consider themselves a Christian of some sort (Catholic, Protestant,  Orthodox, Other in that order). Agnosticism and Atheism are pretty  evenly split for the remaining 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

AuthCenters  make up just over twice the combined total of the other Auth Quadrants  combined with AuthLeft coming in second at only 11 people and AuthRight  with 7. We didn’t have any centrist or libertarian lurkers.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re  mostly culturally conservative, unsurprisingly. 22 of us consider  ourselves “Extremely Conservative”, 18 “Conservative”, 12 “Neutral”, 2  “Progressive”, and 1 “Extremely Progressive”. Contrary to what some  people have said, it definitely doesn’t seem like we’re being overrun by  progs at all, or at least not as far as the results indicate.

&amp;#x200B;

We  had around 15 fascists respond, which was the most common response for  ideology. National Socialism was the next most common with around 8.  Everything else only got one or two responses, but we have a pretty  broad mix including a couple of nazbols, marxists, monarchists,  nationalists, conservatives, and so on. We apparently even have an  unironic burgundian system supporter. Thank you to Greed who decided to  write me a 585 word explanation of his ideology despite everyone else  giving a 1-10 word response like everyone else, save for the fascist who  explained things a bit more in depth (35 words to be exact) and for  good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

6  People are registered members of a political party. The parties in  question are Republican (3), Swiss Nationalist Party (1), Green (1),  American Nazi Party (1). To whoever said you’re a part of the cock and  ball torture party, I hope you’re having a nice time.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re  actually pretty diverse when it comes to hobbies, but the most common  ones are related to sports and fitness, religion, history, the  outdoors/nature, and anything creative (drawing, painting, photography,  music, writing, etc).

I'll likely graph everything myself and make an updated post sometime later this week for anyone interested so I can include all of the information instead of only the most common answers. That said, 55 people here took the census, so I'm providing a breakdown of a big chunk of the info until I finish everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of this sub is zoomers or younger millennials. 56.4 % of respondents are between the ages of 13-17, 38.2% are between 18-24. We have 2 people here between 25-29, and one person who responded is 35-39.

&amp;#x200B;

The United States is by far the country with the most people from this subreddit, making up 40% or 22 people. Next was the United Kingdom with 4. Turkey, Serbia, Poland, Italy, and China had 2 each. We also had one person each from Sweden, Slovenia, Russia, Romania, Portugal, Netherlands, Malaysia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Latvia, Ireland, India, Hungary, Estonia, Croatia, Canada, and Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost everyone here is white. Most respondents didn’t expand beyond that but most of those who did defined themselves as Slavic, Aryan, Anglo, or European (and a handful of people simply put one of those four with nothing else), though there were a handful of other responses. We also have one person who is mostly white with some African and Native American. Non White responses include Han Chinese (2), Turkic (2), Hindu (2), Arab (1), Middle Eastern (1), Hispanic (1). We only had one person say the gamer word, so congrats lads.

&amp;#x200B;

Unsurprisingly it’s a sausagefest here. 50 of us are male (90.9%) and we have one person who chose female. We also had one response each in the “other” field for trans woman, agender, femboy, and genderless.

&amp;#x200B;

This sub is almost 75% heterosexual (technically over 75% if we’re counting the “normal” and “heterosexual+asexual” responses). Bisexual was the next most common at 9% with 5 people. Beyond that we have Homosexual (2), Androsexual (1), Asexual (2), Unsure (2)

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us are religious (70.7% overall), and half of the total responders consider themselves a Christian of some sort (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Other in that order). Agnosticism and Atheism are pretty evenly split for the remaining 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

AuthCenters make up just over twice the combined total of the other Auth Quadrants combined with AuthLeft coming in second at only 11 people and AuthRight with 7. We didn’t have any centrist or libertarian lurkers.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re mostly culturally conservative, unsurprisingly. 22 of us consider ourselves “Extremely Conservative”, 18 “Conservative”, 12 “Neutral”, 2 “Progressive”, and 1 “Extremely Progressive”. Contrary to what some people have said, it definitely doesn’t seem like we’re being overrun by progs at all, or at least not as far as the results indicate.

&amp;#x200B;

We had around 15 fascists respond, which was the most common response for ideology. National Socialism was the next most common with around 8. Everything else only got one or two responses, but we have a pretty broad mix including a couple of nazbols, marxists, monarchists, nationalists, conservatives, and so on. We apparently even have an unironic burgundian system supporter. Thank you to Greed who decided to write me a 585 word explanation of his ideology despite everyone else giving a 1-10 word response like everyone else, save for the fascist who explained things a bit more in depth (35 words to be exact) and for good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

6 People are registered members of a political party. The parties in question are Republican (3), Swiss Nationalist Party (1), Green (1), American Nazi Party (1). To whoever said you’re a part of the cock and ball torture party, I hope you’re having a nice time.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re actually pretty diverse when it comes to hobbies, but the most common ones are related to sports and fitness, religion, history, the outdoors/nature, and anything creative (drawing, painting, photography, music, writing, etc). Aside from that we have a few people who are into reading, gaming, programming, science, sci-fi, and engineering. There are too many different answers to list, but that covers the most common things.",,,

What particularly standed out was the user NazbolFemboy told him that he needs to create a new account at this point because no one will trust him now matter what he says. Of course a few days after, said post was deleted and the OP's account apparently was deleted too. Now, recently a few other 0 days old accounts appeared out of nowhere submitting very glowy posts (Not just my opinion).

LGB people can give value to our society, but we should help Trans people with counseling. No shock therapies or beatings, just understanding why they feel that way.


Immigrants should be accepted ONLY if they can show they want to integrate, know the history of the country, and if they prove they integrated through a yearly check-up process. I don't harbor any hate, I'm just sick of politicians' empty words, the bleak future, constant war and the growing divide... we need to be united against threats such as war, global warming and rising suppression of differing opinions.",,,

I also realized something else, it's Zoinist propaganda. PragerU makes videos about why sending billions to Israel is good, and they talk about the wars in the Middle East; however they don't talk about what's happening in Palestine. They only focus on the founding of Israel, and how Muslim countries want to invade Israel; however they don't actually say why people are against Israel. This is flat out Zoinist propaganda, in fact they claim that Zoinism is just supporting the existence of Israel, and not supporting what Israel is doing to Palestine. PragerU wants you to be as uninformed about Israel as possible.

Authoritarianism,The Soul of the People and the Idea of the State,"**Foreword**

Here I will expose my main arguments against cultural, linguistic and civic nationalism, contrasting all of these spurious forms with an ethical and idealist view of the State. I already published an essay on the topic in FULLTOTALITARIAN, yet it was lost when our home sadly fell. In any case, I have read Montesquieu, Rousseau, Hegel and some Neo-Kantians in this time, expanding my understanding of philosophy, and also thought a lot on the topic by myself, reformulating some of my older conceptions in a more complete way. This is why I write this.

**The State as an Idea**

Just as every people has its own traditional clothes, cuisine, folk tales, etc, so every developed nation has its own specific and unique conception of the State. Before we proceed, it should be clear that an Idea of the State is not something reflected explicitly in constitutions and laws (unless they are written by a people already conscious of its Idea of the State, which is a consciousness gained through history and not present from the beginning), but is rather a *metajuridical* phenomenon, that is, one which isn't explicitly written in laws and, perhaps, isn't even man-made in the usual meaning, as it is produced unconsciously.

But *what* is the State? It is, first of all, something related to the realm of spirit rather than to that of the physical body and the soil. It is the highest development of human rationality (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm), § 258) and the result of a long historical progress (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history5.htm#068), § 68). All this is, obviously, referring to the State understood as the object of constitutional law, and not to the polity in international law, upon which we, however, also will touch at a later point of this essay (see Appendix I).

Now, even in this sense the State has two meanings: the political and the *philosophical.* The first one deals with the form of the State, which may vary in different epochs and, of course, in countries with different Ideas of the State. In this sense, the State is *the variety of bureaucratic institutions which represent power and uphold law within a nation,* that is, the government. We see that even in this definition we couldn't leave philosophy aside, as *law* and *power* are notions which we cannot clearly see and touch, so they are already in the field of philosophical knowledge and idealism. However, the State can be described philosophically as *a moral person whose life is in the union of its members* (Rousseau, [The Social Contract](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract/Book_II) , Book II, chapter 4), or, better said, as the *conjunction of all their wills* (Montesquieu, [The Spirit of Laws](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_Laws_(1758)/Book_I), Book I, chapter 2) and the union of the moral characteristics of all the members of the people into a single spirit, which is what we call the *soul of a people*. Throughout this essay, we will prove how the State is the best way of determining this soul and why it is superior for this goal than any other mean, be it the study of culture, language or separate individuals.

*Addition*: Some critics, like the Russian Neo-Kantian Bogdan Kistyakovsky, have stated that Hegel saw the State as a kind of earthly god. Even if this philosopher himself thought such a thing, I do not share such an opinion. God created the world and isn't synonymous with it, for that would render such concepts as ""wordliness"", familiar to every Christian, something fully contradictory. Therefore, neither the people, the State nor history are either gods by itself or emanations of God, and when I refer to the spirit of a people, I mean by that nothing more than a kind of special connection between *human* minds and the mean value of their spiritual characteristics, which leaves a mark on the State and appears as an agent in history. Still, that doesn't deny the enormous value of the State (I hope we are better than the crowd according to Gustave Le Bon, which ""demands a god before everything else"" ([The Crowd](https://archive.org/details/b29815642/page/84/mode/2up), page 84)!), because, even if we can't erect it as an idol, the State still is a relevant mark of human civilisation and a great historical object. However, the State isn't a completely human institution, still less an evil one, for it was given power by God Himself and ""beareth not the sword in vain"" (KJV, Romans 13:4). Its function, consequently, isn't merely to protect the light-hearted pleasure of those who can afford it, but also to enforce morality, for the rulers must be men of truth and hate covetousness (Exodus, 18:21).

**On Cultural Nationalism**

But the State, some say, is just a machine, a swarm of idle bureaucrats or even a bloodsucking parasite. How, they say, will we see freedom, rationality and even the essence of a nation itself in that ""repressive apparatus""? Wouldn't it (according to them) be better to use a beautiful thing, such as high culture, to determine the nation? This notion has spawned a fairly extended ideology known as cultural nationalism, which defines a nation by culture. This is a doctrine which we will proceed to criticise.

The first problem of this conception of nationalism is of a sociological rather than of a philosophical nature. We know that all present and historical societies, from Victorian England to the USSR and from African tribal societies to the Third Reich, have had a high and a low class, which, consequently, always have had a different culture. There always was an equivalent of a class that wears expensive suits, goes to the opera or to the concert hall almost every evening and lives in sumptuous mansions, yet also the counterpart of the one which lives on the streets, wears muscle shirts and spends its leisure in brawls or similar unsophisticated pastimes. So, which of these two cultures (by the way, lest we forget that apart from the aristocracy and the proletariat, there also has often existed a bourgeoisie, a class of merchants, a peasantry, even slaves at some times, etc) will we choose as the true representation of the people? The higher classes too often tend towards cosmopolitism, emulation of whatever is seen as fancy in big foreign cities and a prideful scorn for their humbler compatriots, which makes them largely anti-national, especially because some of them see true nationalism as something no less ""barbaric"" than socialism itself. The culture of the lower classes, on the other hand, simply lacks depth to tackle some of the greatest questions of national and patriotic philosophy to be reliable on this matter.

On the other hand, if the State is, according to Hegel, the synthesis between family and civil society (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR260), § 261), then it also will be the synthesis between poor and rich, proletariat and bourgeoisie, high and low culture. Unlike that utopian view of culture, the State endures the trial of a class society and even, according to Marxists, is an institution made exactly to suit the needs of such a society.

The second objection against cultural nationalism belongs rather to the field of philosophy. Art is an individual creation, so culture is merely a sequence of such individual creations. The Neo-Kantians, in particular, knew this very well. For example, Heinrich Rickert and his Russian disciple Bogdan Kistyakovsky saw history and by extension all of social sciences as the study of *individual* phenomena, while Georg Simmel (*The Problem Areas of Sociology,* in [The Sociology of Georg Simmel](https://archive.org/details/sociologyofgeorg030082mbp/page/n86/mode/1up), pages 17-18) wrote that:

&gt;One may interpret it \[art\] as a pulsation or immediate experience of individual life. Thus viewed, the work of art remains within  the bounds of the individual and his continuity. Certain cultural  data above all art and, in general, everything that has the  breath of creativity appear more easily graspable in such a  perspective than do other data.

Knowing how individualist, therefore, is art, we could learn yet another thing about it. In countries whose national spirit is rather individualist (we will return to this when we discuss in more detail the people's soul), art flourishes, while in countries with a rather collectivist spirit art strongly degrades. Example could be how Great Britain and the United States, which have had a fairly liberal political enviroment for many centuries, have produced great masterpieces of literature, while under some authoritarian regimes literature turns into unfathomable and aesthetically worthless tomes of nihilistic whinning and pseudo-philosophical verbiage. However, the inverse seems to be the case with political theory and social science: historically authoritarian countries make great achievements in these fields, leaving long behind those with a liberal ambient. It is enough to point to the number of pioneers in social science, patriotic philosophers and insightful ideologues in Germany and to the impressive level reached in this field in the old Russian Empire. Western countries may respond merely with some Smiths, Mills and Spencers, whose main point amounted basically to argue that there should be less State, i.e. less policy in economics and less governance in politics, with which they, as economists and political scientists, proved that they wasted their entire lives.

This happens because at the moment of creation, the artist is completely submerged in the world he is creating, at the same time practically ignoring the actual world outside him. Some societies tolerate such individuals, while others consider them to be anti-social and thus somewhat dangerous. But forcing them into the actual world of everyday experience is an error, for this corrupts a writer's idealism instead of enhancing it, raising scornful nihilists rather than committed idealists. This has long been the case in Russia, where the State, always being an authoritarian power, contributed to the degradation of literature, creating a sense of decadent nihilism and extreme pessimism which has been widely common since the nineteenth century. However, under liberal regimes we also see some decay: social matters become uninteresting for the general populace and thus political science turns into an ideological vindication of moral laxity and materialism. A particularly good critique of such a society was made by the great Georges Sorel in the second chapter of his ""[Illusions of Progress](https://archive.org/download/IllusionsofProgress/BookTitle.pdf)"".

From this small inquiry on the nature of art, we can deduce that it is the State that influences culture -- even if it is by the mere fact of its nonexistence or non-intervention -- and not culture that influences the State. Therefore, still less can it influence the nation.

*Addition*: The individualising method, so vigorously defended by Rickert in his *Philosophy of History,* cannot be applied to the State as exclusively as it is applied to culture, to understand which generally, without historical references to separate objects, is impossible. While every country has its specific Idea of the State, we can talk generally of some universal form of it, common to all civilised peoples, which would appear relatively clear to anyone who was already grasped the Idea of the State as we treat it here (although all these reflections are already outside the scope of our present work).

**On Linguistic Nationalism**

This is a form of nationalism that bases the nation on language, for example, like they say that everyone who speaks French *is* French. We will limit ourselves to one argument against this form of nationalism.

Here we will use again the concept of the metajuridical, already mentioned above. Our point is that the spirit of the nation, in what seems like a paradox, doesn't speak that people's tongue. How could ""the peculiar tenor"" of a people's ""moral life"" (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#058),  § 58) speak German or Russian  as men can? Rather, it addresses us with aftersounds of those unseen Ideas which are prefigurations of all known objects, but particularly -- with historical actions, as even history itself speaks through the State. According, for example, to Hippolyte Taine ([The Origins of Contemporary France](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2578/2578-h/2578-h.htm#link2H_4_0042), volume 2, second book, chapter II, § II):

&gt;Each generation is simply the temporary manager and responsible trustee of a precious and glorious patrimony which it has received from the former generation, and which it has to transmit to the one that comes after it.

Something very similar was said by Edmund Burke before him and by Werner Sombart (in *Merchants and Heroes,* a fascinating work which is sadly untranslated into English) after him: the State and the nation both encompass the dead, the living and the yet unborn. In what words could this primigenius contract have been written?

Even apart from this, there are more possible critiques against language nationalism, for example that one may learn another language and even start thinking in it (in fact, I am writing this essay in a tongue that isn't my native), making all this linguistic nationalism generally a voluntary allegiance and thus not so far from civic nationalism.

*Bibliographical note*: I already have said how sorrowful is the unavailability of *Merchants and Heroes* in English, but fortunately I can share my passion for Sombart's thought and recommend some similar reading for those interested, first of all F. Von Hayek's assessment of Sombart and his comrades in [The Road to Serfdom](https://www.falseflag.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Road-to-Serfdom-F.A.-Hayek.pdf) (chapter 12)*,* not because I have the slightest respect for Hayek, but because it is almost the only source from where an English-speaking reader may hear at least something about this particular side of Sombart's work. Some of his books, however, were translated into English, most importantly [German Socialism](https://archive.org/details/sombartgermansocialism1937), a more serene reflection on the German Idea of the State written almost twenty years after *Merchants and Heroes*. Also, the ""comrades"" to whom I have alluded above, in fact, formed a school, which I call the ""*War Socialists*"", which also offers us much worthy material. Despite much of these ""war books"" was written specifically ""for Germans"", many such works were fortunately translated, like Spengler's [Prussianism and Socialism](http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/P%20Soc/Prussianism.Socialism.htm) (which, apart from a significant contribution to War Socialist thought, is a summary of Spengler's philosophy for those who find it tiresome to read the two volumes of *The Decay of the West* entirely), the somewhat more scientific, but still poetic [Three Years of World-Revolution](https://archive.org/details/threeyearsofworl00lensuoft), by Paul Lensch, and [The Third Reich](https://archive.org/details/Ge3rd), by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, which is a masterful recapitulation of key War Socialist themes, as well as the start of an even more vigorous movement called the *Conservative Revolution.* Inside this ""new conservatism"", the thought of [Ernst Niekisch](https://niekischtranslationproject.wordpress.com/) may be seen as an outgrowth of War Socialism, but Ernst Junger's work, especially [Total Mobilisation](https://anarchistwithoutcontent.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/junger-total-mobilization-doc.pdf), also repeats some of the War Socialist arguments in a new way. At last, for those who know German, separate works of the famous Swedish publicist [Rudolf Kjellén](https://archive.org/details/dieideenvoneine00kochgoog) and of [Eduard Stadtler](https://archive.org/search.php?query=eduard%20stadtler) are highly recommended.

**On Civic Nationalism**

One of the assessments I was given for the older version of this essay was an equation of my ideology with something that the critic called ""iliberal civic nationalism"". However, the form of nationalism for which I  am arguing here is opposed to civic nationalism and bourgeois constitutional patriotism in any form, be it liberal, progressive, conservative or authoritarian. I think the arguments put forward previously already could refute civic nationalism with its civil contract, ""daily plebiscite"", ""our democratic values"" and so on. When we stand before the State, we aren't looking at a mere association like those created by artisans in the old days, but at a majestic feat of the human mind, a ""great architectonic structure"", a ""hieroglyph of the reason which reveals itself in actuality"" (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.htm#PR272), § 279, Addition) and at the spirit of an entire people embodied (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#051), § 51). We also have already seen that this spirit includes also the dead and the yet unborn, and that there is no human language in which such a majestic contract may have been written, but to call it a ""contract"" at all can be done just as a metaphor, for the reasons already explained and for some others which we will adduce now.

The biggest argument against civic nationalism is that voluntaryism is a very weak ground to solve any such great questions. The will of men is very unstable, wanting one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, worshipping someone in the morning and killing him in the evening. Georg Simmel, [in another part](https://archive.org/details/sociologyofgeorg030082mbp/page/n95/mode/1up) of the quoted work, presents several examples of all this, not to say Le Bon and Taine. So, we might let the people decide whether we should build a bridge or maybe even questions of policy such as to declare a war (given that such an important question is already allowed to be raised by experienced men), but never to determine what is a nation, as, like we already have said, the lower classes aren't particularly suited to discuss philosophy. If, as some of the most elitist classical liberals directly or indirectly propose, someone tried to resolve this problem by giving freedom only to a few -- to those educated, rich and noble, who are considered enlightened enough to deserve this -- and letting them write these contracts and voluntarily create nations out of thin air, he would fall into a contradiction, for the will of these few is just a partial will as opposed to the general will of the nation. The nation encompasses *everybody* within it: the rich and the poor, the noble and the ignoble, the princes and paupers, the evil and the good. We have already explained this with more detail in the section dealing with cultural nationalism.

**The Relation of the State to Ethnicity**

Another proof that the application of this idealist view of the State to patriotic philosophy does not amount merely to an authoritarian form of civic nationalism is the crucial part played by ethnicity in it. Unfortunately, many reactionaries throughout history have degraded the State to such a level as to suppress a nascent sense of ethnicity  -- the only true form of nationalism -- and, conversely, others have abused the principle of ethnicity to rebel against the State's dignity, to promote vile materialism and capitalism and, at the end, to shame the idea of ethnicity itself. These two are the main errors we shall fight now.

As we have seen, the will of the State, also known as the general will, is the collective will of its members, and, therefore, the Idea of the State is the arithmetical mean of the spiritual characteristics of a people, known as its soul or general spirit, which is determined ""by the climate, the religion, the laws, the maxims of government, by precedents, morals and customs"" (Montesquieu, [The Spirit of Laws](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_Laws_(1758)/Book_XIX), Book XIX, Chapter IV). Some may accuse us of contradiction for citing this particular passage of Montesquieu, for it affirms that it is the State (""laws"" and ""maxims of government"") that determines the spirit of the nation, which would make it impossible for the State to be its embodiment, as that would confuse the cause and the effect, but it is completely logical to see the State as the actualisation of a people's spirit, for the State is the only definite form it can assume, being superior to culture in this aspect.

Now, the State -- and, therefore, the nation -- requires some inamovible principle to serve as its backbone. For the reasons already thoroughly discussed above, it cannot be either culture or language, while land -- preferred by cultural nationalism -- is outside man and thus cannot determine his essence, as we shall discuss in an Appendix. There also are some authors who, like the unhistorical individual from the [Preface](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm#xxvii) of Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*, who tries to ""leap out of his time or jump over Rhodes"", attempt to surpass common sense with their exalted ultra-idealism and to find this *arkhé* of patriotic philosophy in some kind of unfathomably metaphysical ""historical unity"" (this was the error José Ortega y Gasset and his famous disciple José Antonio Primo de Rivera committed) or even in spirit itself, like Spengler or, perhaps, also like the Russian Eurasianists and the immense variety of their vulgar imitators, who inhabit the pages of newspapers such as the infamous *Zavtra* and who fill with their nonsensical books so many ""patriotic"" publishing houses. These exaggerations are easy to refute if we understand their cyclical nature: the State itself is a historical unit, as it was seen by Hegel ([Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#051), § 41), which makes senseless the idea of putting a historical unit as its backbone, while the people's spirit is exactly what we are trying to determine here, so to refer to it again would be a tautology rather than an answer.

That answer which none of them could offer us was found long before them, even before Hegel, by Edmund Burke. In his popular [Reflections on the Revolution in France](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France), he said ""we wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers"", and ""...the parliament says to the king, 'Your subjects have inherited this freedom', claiming their franchises not on abstract principles 'as the rights of men', but as the rights of *Englishmen* \[my emphasis -- K. V\]...""; and ""in this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in *blood* \[my emphasis -- K. V\]..."": this is the great truth which our contemporaries lack the boldness to vindicate!

It is in ancestry, poetically speaking, in *blood,* where the spirit of the nation is seen, yet blood can scream only from the grave (Genesis, 4:10) and not so often appears in the life of a living man. Blood is inside men and inherent to every one of them (even if it is mixed, for the object of true nationalism is not absolute purity, but merely the prevailing element, while the existence of such pure elements is already implied in the proposition, so often thrown at us, that ""*everybody is mixed*"", in the same way as grey requires also the existence of black and white), though men cannot change it in their lifetime, making ethnicity immune to the excesses of voluntaryism mentioned above. This is how the main characteristics of an ethnic people, living under its own State, are represented in that State.

It was already said several times throughout this essay that the State represents the arithmetic mean of the qualities of all the people, which is also corroborated by Rousseau (""There is often a great deal of difference between the will of all and the general will; the latter considers only the common interest, while the former takes private interest into account, and is no more than a sum of particular wills: but take away from these same wills the pluses and minuses that cancel one another, and the general will remains as the sum of the differences"", [The Social Contract](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract/Book_II#3._Whether_The_General_Will_Is_Fallible), Book II, Chapter III) and by Hegel, who saw in the State the union of the particular and the universal ([Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR260), § 260). It is pointless, therefore, to look at separate persons inductively when inquiring into the people's soul, for in these cases, no matter how many separate individuals will we be able to review, we will surely miss the forest for the trees. It is long known that not all Spaniards are merry, not all Germans are industrious, not all Frenchmen are prideful and so on, but that doesn't deny that every nation has some specific spiritual characteristics. As the lines in Nasca, these characteristics are only seen from above, to be more exact, through something above them that would unite the particulars to make the universal. This is another error in Spengler's view of ""civilisations"": the variety (or absence) of philosophical views within a civilisation, without some outside authority to reduce this variety to the universal, will simply make these differences too great to tackle the influence of a single one of them in history. It might be responded to us that, in this case, culture, including the greatest works of art, will act as this kind of moderator of the civilisation's development. However, we have already stated that culture is merely a flow of individual achievements rather than a single whole as is the State, while to chose some of them as ""great"" or ""classical"" is merely a value judgement, and one which is forced upon us by an enormous institute of elitist academic criticism. Moreover, the philosopher (i.e. Spengler) himself has to interprete these works in such a way that he sees there his ""macrocosms"", which may or may not reflect the intentions of their respective authors, and then to force these macrocosms upon the entire nation, notwithstanding (this should be repeated over and over again) that each work of art is an *individual creation,* while the State, as the union of individual wills, is by definition *collective.*

We can conclude that it is in the State, understood as the apex of individual qualities and wills and most of all as the arithmetic mean of an ethnic people, where we see the best image of nationalism.

All that being said, there are two parts of Fascist/Traditionalist thinking that I think no matter what I can't get behind.

1. I am not, and will never be racist. I can't conceive of myself as hating other races even ironically. Race to me is only a product of skin color. I do not identify with my race (I am not even fully white), and  I just can't understand how anyone could. The only things that matter to me are individuals and their choices, and the State which creates order and stability. 
2. I do not believe in God or Christianity. Epistemologically I  cannot bring myself to believe in a supreme being with a plan for me. The world is too chaotic and cruel for that to be plausible. I also believe that Christianity is an inherently negative force in the world, especially in its current state. Christianity is at the root of the problem that corrupted the west, and I think the days where it had any redeeming qualities have passed.

Authoritarianism,Americans cant be fascist,"Hear me out, americans can't be Fascist and i will tell you why.
 First of all, Here i mean fascist as an American who is nationalistic for the nation of the united states, not white nationalists etcetera. 
Second of all, we need to understand the values of fascism and what it is:
Fascism is founded on Authoritarianism, Collectivism, nationalism, the union of nation &amp; state, idealism and corporatism (the economic fascist kind).
Now, the united states and the ""nation"" of the united states are founded on democratic values and libertarianism, freedom, capitalism, federalism, and individalism— so basically what's called a [""Civic Nation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism?wprov=sfla1).
Therefore, to be nationalistic for america you need to accept and embrace those values, right? But those values inherently go against fascism and fascism is inherently nationalistic. You get what i mean? To be an American Nationalist you need to embrace civic values, but fascism is inherently against those and fascism is, of course, very nationalistic.",,,

Authoritarianism,How Authoritarian would this be Auth enough for a monarchy I was going to ask a simple question but then it turned to this I personally am a constitutional monarchist I dont think a single person will always benefit the people so there should be unchangeable laws that prevent the monarch from doing certain things laws guarded by not only the public but also some of the best soldiers and highest technology possible When it comes to religion Im only against the abrahamic religions but wouldnt outlaw any of them Instead Paganism of various kinds would be promoted I am for free speech but the people should have no direct say in government I dont want innocent comedians to be taken to jail over an edgy joke Market should be free for the most part Some things like weapons medicine and utilities should be regulated by the government for the safety of the citizens When it comes to ownership of firearms pretty much anyone without an extreme mental disease can but one although the process would be long and easilyconcealed weapons should take much longer to get and the buyer must have proof that they absolutely need one Personally Im against spying on your own citizens and having incredibly high security everywhere but high security is a great way to keep people safe from any potential threats Small businesses should be prioritized and incentivized over large corporations at all times Along with that protection of the environment and wildlife should be a concern Theres no point in having anything if the world burns Finally the country should have mostly closed borders Tourism should be allowed but incredibly regulated Immigration into the country should be hard but not impossible depending on where the migrant is coming from Those coming from a place radically different from Iran to Sweden for example should not be allowed in And depending on the country should depend on what it trades and who it trades with and hopefully it would trade with neighbors but that is not always possible,"I was going to ask a simple question, but then it turned to this. 

I personally am a constitutional monarchist, I don’t think a single person will always benefit the people, so there should be unchangeable laws that prevent the monarch from doing certain things, laws guarded by not only the public but also some of the best soldiers and highest technology possible. 

When it comes to religion, I’m only against the abrahamic religions, but wouldn’t outlaw any of them. Instead, Paganism of various kinds would be promoted. 

I am for free speech, but the people should have no direct say in government. I don’t want innocent comedians to be taken to jail over an edgy joke. 

Market should be free, for the most part. Some things, like weapons, medicine, and utilities, should be regulated by the government for the safety of the citizens. 

When it comes to ownership of firearms, pretty much anyone without an extreme mental disease can but one, although the process would be long and easily-concealed weapons should take much longer to get and the buyer must have proof that they absolutely need one. 

Personally, I’m against spying on your own citizens and having incredibly high security everywhere, but high security is a great way to keep people safe from any potential threats. 

Small businesses should be prioritized and incentivized over large corporations at all times. Along with that, protection of the environment and wildlife should be a concern. There’s no point in having anything if the world burns. 

Finally, the country should have mostly closed borders. Tourism should be allowed, but incredibly regulated. Immigration into the country should be hard, but not impossible depending on where the migrant is coming from. Those coming from a place radically different (from Iran to Sweden, for example), should not be allowed in. And depending on the country should depend on what it trades and who it trades with, and hopefully it would trade with neighbors, but that is not always possible.",,,

I believe Christianity in Europe should be placed above all other religions and whilst I am okay with Islam, Judaism etc. in my Ideal society they'd be strictly regulated and would not be allowed to work in Government or parliament/senate. LGBTQ people would not face prosecution but we would not teach children about it in Schools and other places of learning, same goes for Transgender people. 

Government: Here's the curve ball I believe in total freedom of speech, protest and journalism, however I do not believe that the general public should have a say in what happens to their country, sort of like the Roman Empire under a few Emperors.

Social issues- I am opposed to transexuality and i think it should be banned, i am fine with homo and bisexuality tho. I am against abortion unless it is a non-european or the baby has a mental or sever physical disability. I want a nation with only Europeans in it.   


Government- I want governmental surveillance of everyone, everywhere at all times of the day (except for in the bathroom and such). I want the government to be able to impose what ever laws they want, when they want. I want the police to have military grade equipment and they should have a lot more power and protection than they currently do. Schools should teach to love the goverment. There should be a ban on ideologies shuch as communism, anarchism, libertarianism and liberalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Economy- i want the economy to be strictly controlled by the state, society would be organized into different areas of employment like military, agriculture, engineering, etc called corporations that the government assigenes people to your employment into these is designated by your interests and skills, then the government sets a goal like for example the production of 40,000 cars per month with the expectation the standard is met. I would want things like social wefare and puplic healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

Foreign policy- I hate interventionism, i want completely closed borders, a ethno-state. I am a pan-European. I want mono-culturalism. I want to avoid wars as much as possible.",,,

Social Ideology - I'm a pretty (very) liberal person when it comes to social issues. Pro Gay marriage/rights and pro abortion, honestly I don't care who you have a relationship with or how many babies you abort as long as it's legal and doesn't affect me. 

Economic Ideology - I'm not as liberal when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Where I live healthcare is free, I support free healthcare for all. Other than that however, I want the government to spend less to keep our taxes low.

Government Ideology - I believe in an authoritarian government. I would make mass protests illegal, and crack down on anti-government press coverage and social groups. I would do this to stop the spread of political violence that seems to infect every crevice of western society today.

In conclusion, I support a authoritarian progressive conservative agenda... or at least I think that's what it would be called. Any help would be appreaciated as I'm in the middle of a political ideology crisis.",,,

I’m a nerd, and I love studying different ideologies. I’ve commented here and there, and had a couple conversations here, but most of the time I just watch and learn. Irony being what it is, I really wouldn’t call myself an authoritarian by any real means, except when I go through the “if I were in charge of ____” rabbit hole.

Here are some lessons:

1.Never try to coup

I didn't really like the technocrats and the fake auths so i decided to go apeshit and ban you guys like a removed. I succeded but boy do I regret it. I'd do anything to have the old sub back

2. Name it some random sh1t: Name it like ahfanhraj or something and say its a private anti hate sub.

3. Don't be a dick to your auths: Yeah admin trust does nothing. I pretended to suck ahs cock for a month and they still banned it

4. NO reposts. 

I got no warnings from reddit and I was the only one who posted. It had to be an automatic action based off of my full tot reposts. If ya want some old memes I can dm them to you.

Yeah so I'm so sorry guys I f@cked up at least learn from my mistakes. Please feel free to re make the subs with these lessons.

It kept the peace in the middle east, you know the headache he bri'ish had trying to solve the problems there after WW1 and if it kept the peace, the USA could do shit like worrying about their own people, not about we jews, this way solving a lot of problems, like solving the question : why in Discord we have 🅱️ and B, but with blue background, but not outside discord?",,,

But except for  the really crazily outrageous-most instances of this, there is more free-speech in an ultra-authoritan régime than there would be in an anarchic society ... because in an anarchic (in the sense of lacking _central_  governance) society, curb on free-speech will _emerge spontaneously_  through the struttings &amp; posturings of self-appointed 'mighty ones' who have the knack of cowing others, &amp; love cowing others, by their blusterings &amp; glowerings &amp; their making-out as though they are about to hit something ... &amp; this will set a curb at free-speech _far_  tighter than the curb _any_  central government - other than the _verymost_  extreme ones - _could possibly_  impose.

It's just exposing what has already existed. The U.S. has a ""Muh freedom and muh rights"" degenerate morality that doesn't emphasize sacrifice, honor, or moral duty to other people and now COVID19 has exposed this. A disease that doesn't seem to care about property rights doesn't seem to be complying the average American's libertarian ideology. You have issues getting people to even wear mask much less sacrifice any more serious inconveniences or hardships required to save lives. You also have a state that refuses to supply universal healthcare to it's citizens or sufficient financial relief. This coupled with the fact that almost all Americans have both parents working to pay the bills and have very little savings to support the bourgeois capitalists class living as parasites off it's workers.

Liberal capitalism which views people as individual work widgets and not members of larger nations of people has been importing millions of people from around the world. This has led to racial conflict that makes dealing with any other issue almost impossible.  We are witnessing the death of liberalism and it's probably going to take what's left of Western civilization with it. A proper authoritarian system needs to replace it.",,,

Authoritarianism,Final message from FULLTOTALITARIAN,"Two things:

1. **Alternative subreddits**  
Creating a FT alternative on Reddit is not going to work. Any subreddit looking to emulate or replace it will just get removed instantly without appeal. It doesn't matter if you follow the reddit rules by the letter, if your subreddit qualifies as a ""ban-evasion"" sub then it will just be banned as well.   
There are some splinter-communities outside of reddit that you can join. They're not run by the original mod team but you'll be with the same type of crowd. If you know of one of these communities, please do share them here in the comments.

2. **FULLTOTALITARIAN's ban explained**  
As you'll know there are two individuals running around claiming that they got the subreddit banned. Neither of those are directly responsible for it.  
The first is quartz_king. This is the retard that was mad he got banned because he couldn't spam the n-word. So to own the auths he wen't to AHS.  
The second is shyguystreams. This twerp reported the subreddit to the admins directly and thinks that he was responsible when it was banned later. He definitely wasn't the first, back in september I sent [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/7CiIEQj.png) to my pal on the mod team when the first person that reported it revealed themselves. Over the past month I've gotten countless of those messages. I don't know if shyguystreams is genuinely autistic or not but he's made ""getting the sub banned"" his entire personality now.  
Admins don't really care about individual reports, if there aren't many people reporting a subreddit it's either not very popular or those reports are false-positives. Once a certain threshold of reports is reached they actually take action. 

---

So, there is no contingency plan set up for trying to recreate the subreddit as ban-evasion is futile. If I ever make another subreddit it will be about something else, and probably with moderation turned up to eleven to ensure people follow the rules.

Try not to get banned until then.",,,

Authoritarianism,We have a goal With the fall of full totalitarian we now know that any sub we flee to will be shut down in a matter of time This is evident by the other subs people have been making in replacement thag have been shut down in a matter of hours or days This will happen with this sub to inevitably and likely soon They have likely tagged multiple of the users in both subs and are tracking them But that is not the pointWe do not need a sub to call home We have no home in this hell hole Nor do we need one to stay up for long All we need is a presence on reddit If we have that we can recruit more brethren to the causeIn order to have a presence on reddit with the monitoring of us the goal will not be to evade suspicion                        Instead the goal will be to recruit as many brethren as possible Thus gives us some freedom We can be more open in our beliefs As it doesnt matter what we say They will take it down Also It will draw in people that already agree with us and others that may still be on the fence Those we do recruit we will bring back to a second platform like discord There likely wont be one big server for all of us to plan in Instead we will be a web that communicates with one another all with the same goal To spread the word of our authoritarian beliefs,"With the fall of full totalitarian we now know that any sub we flee to will be shut down in a matter of time. This is evident by the other subs people have been making in replacement thag have been shut down in a matter of hours or days. This will happen with this sub to inevitably and likely soon. They have likely tagged multiple of the users in both subs and are tracking them. But that is not the point.

We do not need a sub to call home. We have no home in this hell hole. Nor do we need one to stay up for long. All we need is a presence on reddit. If we have that, we can recruit more brethren to the cause.

In order to have a presence on reddit with the monitoring of us the goal will not be to evade suspicion. 
       
                Instead the goal will be to recruit as many brethren as possible. Thus gives us some freedom. We can be more open in our beliefs. As it doesn't matter what we say. They will take it down. Also It will draw in people that already agree with us and others that may still be on the fence. Those we do recruit we will bring back to a second platform like discord. 

There likely won't be one big server for all of us to plan in. Instead we will be a web that communicates with one another all with the same goal. To spread the word of our authoritarian beliefs.",,,

Authoritarianism,Hello  Im a MestizoLatino national socialist Am I based,"My profile says it all. I aim to unite Latin America under a national socialist regime. Yes I know Latin America is too diverse and all but hear me out. I advocate for the following:

1. Pan-Latin Americanism. This is a type of pan-nationalism that seeks for a pan-ethnocultural unity of the Latino people. Race, religion, and language do not matter, but culture and ethnicity do. As long as you have ancestry in Latin America then you're welcome.

2. A state-directed economy, or state capitalism. Like Nazi Germany's economy, I believe at least 40% of the economy should be run by the state while 60% should be run by private businesses but monitored by the state. I believe private businesses should put the interests of the nation before their own interests. I also don't believe in 100% autarky (maybe 50% at least), but in mercantilism and protectionism.

3. Neopaganism. Yes, I'm basically a Latino Himmler. I believe in state-neopaganism and other beliefs should be abolished. I personally do not trust the Catholic church or the Pope. I believe in multiple supernatural powers instead of one. I believe we should bring back the primordial traditions of ancient civilizations, such as the Aztec and Inca empires, where they would dig someone's heart out in order to communicate with the gods.

Authoritarianism,Who succeeds the leader Part 2,"[Link to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Authoritarianism/comments/j0d230/what_do_you_think_of_my_plan/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), in part 1 I gave a brief overview for the political system which I advocate for an autocratic governor serving as the head of state and government until the age of 65, a consultative legislature whose members are elected via functional representation and for the franchise to be restricted to people who do not have a crimimal record, pay taxes and have completed military or national service.

I mention in part 1, that I believe that the governor should be elected indirectly. An electoral college should be convened five years before the incumbent's tenure in office is due to end. A good example that I would like to emulate is the 1958 French Presidental election. The President should be elected by a college of national, regional and local representatives, governors, mayors, judges, members of the civil services, religious leaders etc. 

Wherever possible representatives should act as delegates. Delegates should consult with citizens eligible to vote and in the manner of the US presidential caucuses direct their representatives to vote in a certain manner in the electoral college.

That leaves one thing left, where should the prospective candidates for the governorship come from. Looking at the current Chinese political system, I propose that there should be two-tiers of leadership at the national level which qualifies onself to becoming the governor one-day. 

1) A central committee consisting of experienced parliamentarians (head of committees etc), former governors, CEOs of major companies etc. 
2) A politburo consisting of nine members, including the current president. The remaining members would be selected from the central committee, they would be tasked to lead independent national agencies equivalent to the US's CIA, FBI, Central Bank, SEC etc.

I'm going to sound like such a larper here, but...

&amp;#x200B;

We should not, under no pretext or circumstances, make any sort of ""peace"" with the progfash. No progfash moderators alongside traditionalists. We have to stand tall against the progfash. No compromise. I would rather get banned for the 14th time and make a new account, which takes all but about 30 seconds, than compromise with the vermin we swore to protect our families against. Like why are we even worried about getting banned anyway? It's going to happen sooner or later. It always happens. It will happen again. Ironically, in Reddit's pursuit of a free speech haven they ban anyone who disagrees with their anarcho-libertarian horseshit. Yes, it is unfortunate we have the Reddit ""yikes sweetie"" faggot gestapo invading our sovereign promised land, but their posts meant to make this worse are unironically correct. LGBT issues, ESPECIALLY the T part, are some of the most anti-traditionalist rhetoric I have heard. It does not matter whether or not you support a plethora of other ideas, you are progressive on one of the largest issues that affects Authoritarians. We do not support you. We do not want you. Make your own subreddit if you want, but stay out of mine.

First of all, I want to apologize for putting this off for so long. I was not, and am still not sure of the best way to handle this situation. 

This subreddit has experienced a lot of growth recently, and with that growth a few rather controversial problems. It definitely needs more moderating but the issue is figuring out how to moderate.

My philosophy with this subreddit has always been a lax approach and letting the users and Reddit's voting system determine what content is good. However, we can all tell that it's not working that well.

I am not an expert on authoritarian theory, nor am I an authoritarian. I am probably the least qualified person here. I have received upwards of 30-40 messages from people asking to be mod and making their cases, so I couldn't just randomly pick some because it wouldn't be the best for the subreddit.

With that being said, I'm not sure how to choose more mods. Voting sounds rather unauthoritarian, so I'm just going to try my best to choose 3-4 people who are representative of the community as a whole and have them make the decisions. 

If you would like to become a mod, or if you would like someone else to become a mod, leave a comment below with some reasons why you should be mod. You can also leave a comment if you have suggestions for the subreddit. I will be disregarding all previous messages as there are simply too many and it wouldn't be fair to consider only some.

Authoritarianism,Guys plz,"Alright welp, who knew you were actually serious about this. Now I'm legit kind of scared. There were a lot of third party people just echoing sToP dA wAr U gLoWiEz but no one actually gave a solution. I don't think you know how war works, even if it's a made up one. So, here I present to you my solution which I bet neither side will like but you gotta make due with what you have.

Progs will remove things like ""homo"", ""trans"", etc, etc from their flairs and in return at least two trads mentioned on this [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Authoritarianism/comments/kkmdfo/i_made_this_and_yes_im_playing_both_sides_so_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) will make a frogfashwave. Obviously both sides will stop memeing eachother.

It actually saddens me to see that the only solution you could see is creating a separate sub and discord..

Anyways, this deal isn't only open to discussion for progs but for trads too since, as I said, nobody will be satisfied. I don't want from you to like the other side, let's just agree to disagree and move on.",,,

Authoritarianism,How would you feel about a discussion based sub,"Hello all, 

One thing I do very much enjoy about this sub is the discussion of Authoritarian policies and debating about various ideologies. Unfortunately, those posts are often rare and, given the lack of moderation in this sub, often get overshadowed by memes or *other posts*.

So I had an idea: what about a primarily discussion-based sub? I think it would be very informative, but I would like to know what others think. Thanks!

I am still (and probably always) a socially conservative, economically leftist, total authoritarian. I have been some brand of authoritarian for most of my (albeit short) life, natsoc, natsynd, class fash, and I have believed in the &gt;muh return to trad and &gt;muh degens for most of it, even successfully converting many in my life to follow this third position. 

But all this time I knew something was missing, because my lived experience in my country is that it does not have a history, or a tradition, and is what I would call a Synthetic nation-state; one not formed from a rooted people tied to their land as you Europeans or Mainland Chinese do, or formed through armed struggle for the sake of liberty as you Americans were. And seeing the modern condition, aren't we all? 

Your histories and traditions commodified through rampant capitalism post WW2, perverted through the lenses of neo-cons, neo-libs and the mainstream consciousness to fit whatever agenda they want to push. 

The usual heroes of us auths like daddy A, uncle B M, or even uncle Corneliu for you clerical fash had all not only failed, but cannibalised and were cannibalised by the very auths they swore to arms with, and were historically, a massive failure for the Auth movement. 

I would say that we are haunted by the ghosts of lost futures, imagining for a future that already left, based on a past that never really existed. 

To illustrate this, when natsocs want a return to tradition, which one? The wheat fields and agricultural lifestyle which, frankly, never existed in any sustainable capacity? And even if it were, it is simply not one that is feasible in our current historical circumstance. 

When we talk about returning to the values of old, which one? If we were to live as our forefathers did, and embody their traditions, then we would have to concede and commit horrible acts of violence as well. Back when we had the idealised nuclear family, domestic abuse was frequent and rampant, and even for the misogynistic auths out there, you have to concede that the nuclear family cannot function to its full potential when there is such a dysfunction as domestic abuse. So clearly when auths (in good faith) claim for a ""return to tradition"", is it really a tradition we want to return to, or an idealised past that we made for ourselves?

But what is our modern malaise? A global economic system that deterritorializes, schizophrenises and nullifies meaning, technological progression that is a zero sum game for humanity as a whole, and a great societal anterograde amnesia and depression caused by a lack of meaning, while capital itself uses and exploits trite differences through identity politics to further atomise and antagonise the peoples of our nations. We are facing a radically different reality than our forefathers ever did, with material conditions the likes of which were never seen before.

The point I'm making is that we have come to a point in history that has entirely severed us from our past, and that for a coherent, reasonable authoritarian force for now and the future, a radical reflection must be done, one that is materialist, one that is frank and honest with itself, and one that is not afraid to leap forward without looking back. And until such a ""new authoritarianism"" can exist, there simply is no political label that I can wear. 

If anyone else is interested in such a discussion, or even a traditional critique of what I've said, feel free to comment or PM me. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",,,

Authoritarianism,Heres a break from the war Lets talk about Yockey,"For those of you who have read *Imperium* by a Francis Parker Yockey, known for being a lawyer for the Nuremburg Trials (who obviously didn't agree with it) until he left, got arrested, and imprisoned; then ""suiciding himself"". For the less refined like me, he's the ""haha funi gamer"" president in a HOI4 mod.

I got his book for Christmas because he interested me a great deal, and his views are definitely very esoteric and a little wack at times. I read through the front pages of the book before getting into the meat of it (the publishing company had a sonnenrad printed beneath their info, very nice) and his chapter titles were both interesting and funny as hell. ""Cultural Retardation as a form of Cultural Distortion"". ""The Negro in America"". ""The Abyss"". It's funny because I don't know how the fuck he got away with it. It was dedicated to the Hero of Europe. Sounds like our favorite Argentinian Uncle to me. ;)

Anyways, enough talk about the front and onto the 45 or so pages I read for today. It was all about Yockey's view of history and what lens to view it through. He discussed ""supercultures"", i.e. those of China, the Ancient Aegean, Islam, the Pre-Columbian, and Europe. Their rise and fall, and how all cultures have a lifetime and go through a cycle, all very Hegelian but with a proper, *spiritual* outlook instead of merely materialistic. He, in fact, goes on to criticize materialism and the common western view that history is progress, which is simply not true. Everything that rises must fall and be replaced, eventually. 

My favorite quote from all of this is one Yockey definitely wanted the reader to remember, seeing as he italicized it. ""History is the relationship between the Past and Present"". It's such a simple statement of fact that we all subconsciously know, but Yockey has seemed to present it in a conscious way that makes sense. He actually goes on to view how we view history, and adds to the quote ""history is written by the victors"" to ""history changes due to the current conditions"", perhaps hinting at how the conditions in 1948, do not need to view an Uncle A as good now, but perhaps, sometime soon... he will be.

My only criticism is HOW he writes. He's very eccentric like his inspiration and needs editorial work, and often uses larger words that I think could be broken up at times, and sometimes he'll jump around a bit. I'll get used to it as time goes on!

Let me know if you want me to make this a series, or if you don't like it I take it down. I also have Spengler's *Decline of the West* I can discuss too. But, most importantly, **let me know what you think!** I posted this here to discuss with you all. 

And, as a P.S., I resign from this cursed war. I would rather not have degeneracy in my ranks but I would also rather not side with AHS. I offer an olive branch in friendship.

Our biggest problem is that r/authoritarianism doesn't feels like r/FULLTOTALITARIAN, It should be more like its ancestor.

Here are some of the steps I think we should take to make it like that:
1. Have an actual logo and a banner to give it more life
2. Have r/NazbolFemboy or r/PrettyFlyforAnonBi to be moderators (if they agree)
3. Have a strict anti bigotry rule, ban anyone posting bigoted posts or comments, if we want to preserve this space we must follow this rule
4. Lastly, make this sub private forever, we can invite people who are authoritarian via r/politicalcompass by looking at their results.

Again:⚠️DO NOT INVITE RACISTS⚠️, this sub is intended for discussion of authoritarian political theory and memes, this is not your safe space for being a bigot.",,,

Love scrolling through this sub to get different opinions and see other’s views on things. I like discussing with people about politics and economics, and the difference between an anarchist and an authoritarian is so drastic I imagine there’s a lot to talk about. 

I’m more specifically a voluntarist or an anarcho-capitalist. One thing to note about my ideology is that given property rights, communities would be totally allowed to form with any political/economic model they want, as long as it is voluntary and is not decided on by force. You can have authoritarian and fascist communities, communist or socialist places, theocratic states, ethnostates, whatever it is that you want.

That said, 55 people here took  the census, so I'm providing a breakdown of a big chunk of the info  until I finish everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The  majority of this sub is zoomers or younger millennials. 56.4 % of  respondents are between the ages of 13-17, 38.2% are between 18-24. We  have 2 people here between 25-29, and one person who responded is 35-39.

&amp;#x200B;

The  United States is by far the country with the most people from this  subreddit, making up 40% or 22 people. Next was the United Kingdom with  4. Turkey, Serbia, Poland, Italy, and China had 2 each. We also had one  person each from Sweden, Slovenia, Russia, Romania, Portugal,  Netherlands, Malaysia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Latvia, Ireland, India,  Hungary, Estonia, Croatia, Canada, and Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost  everyone here is white. Most respondents didn’t expand beyond that but  most of those who did defined themselves as Slavic, Aryan, Anglo, or  European (and a handful of people simply put one of those four with  nothing else), though there were a handful of other responses. We also  have one person who is mostly white with some African and Native  American. Non White responses include Han Chinese (2), Turkic (2), Hindu  (2), Arab (1), Middle Eastern (1), Hispanic (1). We only had one person  say the gamer word, so congrats lads.

&amp;#x200B;

Unsurprisingly  it’s a sausagefest here. 50 of us are male (90.9%) and we have one  person who chose female. We also had one response each in the “other”  field for trans woman, agender, femboy, and genderless.

&amp;#x200B;

This  sub is almost 75% heterosexual (technically over 75% if we’re counting  the “normal” and “heterosexual+asexual” responses). Bisexual was the  next most common at 9% with 5 people. Beyond that we have Homosexual  (2), Androsexual (1), Asexual (2), Unsure (2)

&amp;#x200B;

Most  of us are religious (70.7% overall), and half of the total responders  consider themselves a Christian of some sort (Catholic, Protestant,  Orthodox, Other in that order). Agnosticism and Atheism are pretty  evenly split for the remaining 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

AuthCenters  make up just over twice the combined total of the other Auth Quadrants  combined with AuthLeft coming in second at only 11 people and AuthRight  with 7. We didn’t have any centrist or libertarian lurkers.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re  mostly culturally conservative, unsurprisingly. 22 of us consider  ourselves “Extremely Conservative”, 18 “Conservative”, 12 “Neutral”, 2  “Progressive”, and 1 “Extremely Progressive”. Contrary to what some  people have said, it definitely doesn’t seem like we’re being overrun by  progs at all, or at least not as far as the results indicate.

&amp;#x200B;

We  had around 15 fascists respond, which was the most common response for  ideology. National Socialism was the next most common with around 8.  Everything else only got one or two responses, but we have a pretty  broad mix including a couple of nazbols, marxists, monarchists,  nationalists, conservatives, and so on. We apparently even have an  unironic burgundian system supporter. Thank you to Greed who decided to  write me a 585 word explanation of his ideology despite everyone else  giving a 1-10 word response like everyone else, save for the fascist who  explained things a bit more in depth (35 words to be exact) and for  good reason.

Backstory: a few days ago the user u/Shyguystreams made a submission to this subreddit and he got bullied in the comments like usual. What particularly standed out was the user NazbolFemboy told him that he needs to create a new account at this point because no one will trust him now matter what he says. Of course a few days after, said post was deleted and the OP's account apparently was deleted too. Now, recently a few other 0 days old accounts appeared out of nowhere submitting very glowy posts (Not just my opinion). So, to make my and most other users' stance perfectly clear: You are a liar and we will never trust you, no matter how much you say you've changed (the fact you've ""changed"" so much for so little time is also very suspicious).

They only focus on the founding of Israel, and how Muslim countries want to invade Israel; however they don't actually say why people are against Israel. This is flat out Zoinist propaganda, in fact they claim that Zoinism is just supporting the existence of Israel, and not supporting what Israel is doing to Palestine. PragerU wants you to be as uninformed about Israel as possible.

Authoritarianism,The Soul of the People and the Idea of the State,"**Foreword**

Here I will expose my main arguments against cultural, linguistic and civic nationalism, contrasting all of these spurious forms with an ethical and idealist view of the State. I already published an essay on the topic in FULLTOTALITARIAN, yet it was lost when our home sadly fell. In any case, I have read Montesquieu, Rousseau, Hegel and some Neo-Kantians in this time, expanding my understanding of philosophy, and also thought a lot on the topic by myself, reformulating some of my older conceptions in a more complete way. This is why I write this.

**The State as an Idea**

Just as every people has its own traditional clothes, cuisine, folk tales, etc, so every developed nation has its own specific and unique conception of the State. Before we proceed, it should be clear that an Idea of the State is not something reflected explicitly in constitutions and laws (unless they are written by a people already conscious of its Idea of the State, which is a consciousness gained through history and not present from the beginning), but is rather a *metajuridical* phenomenon, that is, one which isn't explicitly written in laws and, perhaps, isn't even man-made in the usual meaning, as it is produced unconsciously.

But *what* is the State? It is, first of all, something related to the realm of spirit rather than to that of the physical body and the soil. It is the highest development of human rationality (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm), § 258) and the result of a long historical progress (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history5.htm#068), § 68). All this is, obviously, referring to the State understood as the object of constitutional law, and not to the polity in international law, upon which we, however, also will touch at a later point of this essay (see Appendix I).

Now, even in this sense the State has two meanings: the political and the *philosophical.* The first one deals with the form of the State, which may vary in different epochs and, of course, in countries with different Ideas of the State. In this sense, the State is *the variety of bureaucratic institutions which represent power and uphold law within a nation,* that is, the government. We see that even in this definition we couldn't leave philosophy aside, as *law* and *power* are notions which we cannot clearly see and touch, so they are already in the field of philosophical knowledge and idealism. However, the State can be described philosophically as *a moral person whose life is in the union of its members* (Rousseau, [The Social Contract](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract/Book_II) , Book II, chapter 4), or, better said, as the *conjunction of all their wills* (Montesquieu, [The Spirit of Laws](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_Laws_(1758)/Book_I), Book I, chapter 2) and the union of the moral characteristics of all the members of the people into a single spirit, which is what we call the *soul of a people*. Throughout this essay, we will prove how the State is the best way of determining this soul and why it is superior for this goal than any other mean, be it the study of culture, language or separate individuals.

*Addition*: Some critics, like the Russian Neo-Kantian Bogdan Kistyakovsky, have stated that Hegel saw the State as a kind of earthly god. Even if this philosopher himself thought such a thing, I do not share such an opinion. God created the world and isn't synonymous with it, for that would render such concepts as ""wordliness"", familiar to every Christian, something fully contradictory. Therefore, neither the people, the State nor history are either gods by itself or emanations of God, and when I refer to the spirit of a people, I mean by that nothing more than a kind of special connection between *human* minds and the mean value of their spiritual characteristics, which leaves a mark on the State and appears as an agent in history. Still, that doesn't deny the enormous value of the State (I hope we are better than the crowd according to Gustave Le Bon, which ""demands a god before everything else"" ([The Crowd](https://archive.org/details/b29815642/page/84/mode/2up), page 84)!), because, even if we can't erect it as an idol, the State still is a relevant mark of human civilisation and a great historical object. However, the State isn't a completely human institution, still less an evil one, for it was given power by God Himself and ""beareth not the sword in vain"" (KJV, Romans 13:4). Its function, consequently, isn't merely to protect the light-hearted pleasure of those who can afford it, but also to enforce morality, for the rulers must be men of truth and hate covetousness (Exodus, 18:21).

**On Cultural Nationalism**

But the State, some say, is just a machine, a swarm of idle bureaucrats or even a bloodsucking parasite. How, they say, will we see freedom, rationality and even the essence of a nation itself in that ""repressive apparatus""? Wouldn't it (according to them) be better to use a beautiful thing, such as high culture, to determine the nation? This notion has spawned a fairly extended ideology known as cultural nationalism, which defines a nation by culture. This is a doctrine which we will proceed to criticise.

The first problem of this conception of nationalism is of a sociological rather than of a philosophical nature. We know that all present and historical societies, from Victorian England to the USSR and from African tribal societies to the Third Reich, have had a high and a low class, which, consequently, always have had a different culture. There always was an equivalent of a class that wears expensive suits, goes to the opera or to the concert hall almost every evening and lives in sumptuous mansions, yet also the counterpart of the one which lives on the streets, wears muscle shirts and spends its leisure in brawls or similar unsophisticated pastimes. So, which of these two cultures (by the way, lest we forget that apart from the aristocracy and the proletariat, there also has often existed a bourgeoisie, a class of merchants, a peasantry, even slaves at some times, etc) will we choose as the true representation of the people? The higher classes too often tend towards cosmopolitism, emulation of whatever is seen as fancy in big foreign cities and a prideful scorn for their humbler compatriots, which makes them largely anti-national, especially because some of them see true nationalism as something no less ""barbaric"" than socialism itself. The culture of the lower classes, on the other hand, simply lacks depth to tackle some of the greatest questions of national and patriotic philosophy to be reliable on this matter.

On the other hand, if the State is, according to Hegel, the synthesis between family and civil society (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR260), § 261), then it also will be the synthesis between poor and rich, proletariat and bourgeoisie, high and low culture. Unlike that utopian view of culture, the State endures the trial of a class society and even, according to Marxists, is an institution made exactly to suit the needs of such a society.

The second objection against cultural nationalism belongs rather to the field of philosophy. Art is an individual creation, so culture is merely a sequence of such individual creations. The Neo-Kantians, in particular, knew this very well. For example, Heinrich Rickert and his Russian disciple Bogdan Kistyakovsky saw history and by extension all of social sciences as the study of *individual* phenomena, while Georg Simmel (*The Problem Areas of Sociology,* in [The Sociology of Georg Simmel](https://archive.org/details/sociologyofgeorg030082mbp/page/n86/mode/1up), pages 17-18) wrote that:

&gt;One may interpret it \[art\] as a pulsation or immediate experience of individual life. Thus viewed, the work of art remains within  the bounds of the individual and his continuity. Certain cultural  data above all art and, in general, everything that has the  breath of creativity appear more easily graspable in such a  perspective than do other data.

Knowing how individualist, therefore, is art, we could learn yet another thing about it. In countries whose national spirit is rather individualist (we will return to this when we discuss in more detail the people's soul), art flourishes, while in countries with a rather collectivist spirit art strongly degrades. Example could be how Great Britain and the United States, which have had a fairly liberal political enviroment for many centuries, have produced great masterpieces of literature, while under some authoritarian regimes literature turns into unfathomable and aesthetically worthless tomes of nihilistic whinning and pseudo-philosophical verbiage. However, the inverse seems to be the case with political theory and social science: historically authoritarian countries make great achievements in these fields, leaving long behind those with a liberal ambient. It is enough to point to the number of pioneers in social science, patriotic philosophers and insightful ideologues in Germany and to the impressive level reached in this field in the old Russian Empire. Western countries may respond merely with some Smiths, Mills and Spencers, whose main point amounted basically to argue that there should be less State, i.e. less policy in economics and less governance in politics, with which they, as economists and political scientists, proved that they wasted their entire lives.

This happens because at the moment of creation, the artist is completely submerged in the world he is creating, at the same time practically ignoring the actual world outside him. Some societies tolerate such individuals, while others consider them to be anti-social and thus somewhat dangerous. But forcing them into the actual world of everyday experience is an error, for this corrupts a writer's idealism instead of enhancing it, raising scornful nihilists rather than committed idealists. This has long been the case in Russia, where the State, always being an authoritarian power, contributed to the degradation of literature, creating a sense of decadent nihilism and extreme pessimism which has been widely common since the nineteenth century. However, under liberal regimes we also see some decay: social matters become uninteresting for the general populace and thus political science turns into an ideological vindication of moral laxity and materialism. A particularly good critique of such a society was made by the great Georges Sorel in the second chapter of his ""[Illusions of Progress](https://archive.org/download/IllusionsofProgress/BookTitle.pdf)"".

From this small inquiry on the nature of art, we can deduce that it is the State that influences culture -- even if it is by the mere fact of its nonexistence or non-intervention -- and not culture that influences the State. Therefore, still less can it influence the nation.

*Addition*: The individualising method, so vigorously defended by Rickert in his *Philosophy of History,* cannot be applied to the State as exclusively as it is applied to culture, to understand which generally, without historical references to separate objects, is impossible. While every country has its specific Idea of the State, we can talk generally of some universal form of it, common to all civilised peoples, which would appear relatively clear to anyone who was already grasped the Idea of the State as we treat it here (although all these reflections are already outside the scope of our present work).

**On Linguistic Nationalism**

This is a form of nationalism that bases the nation on language, for example, like they say that everyone who speaks French *is* French. We will limit ourselves to one argument against this form of nationalism.

Here we will use again the concept of the metajuridical, already mentioned above. Our point is that the spirit of the nation, in what seems like a paradox, doesn't speak that people's tongue. How could ""the peculiar tenor"" of a people's ""moral life"" (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#058),  § 58) speak German or Russian  as men can? Rather, it addresses us with aftersounds of those unseen Ideas which are prefigurations of all known objects, but particularly -- with historical actions, as even history itself speaks through the State. According, for example, to Hippolyte Taine ([The Origins of Contemporary France](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2578/2578-h/2578-h.htm#link2H_4_0042), volume 2, second book, chapter II, § II):

&gt;Each generation is simply the temporary manager and responsible trustee of a precious and glorious patrimony which it has received from the former generation, and which it has to transmit to the one that comes after it.

Something very similar was said by Edmund Burke before him and by Werner Sombart (in *Merchants and Heroes,* a fascinating work which is sadly untranslated into English) after him: the State and the nation both encompass the dead, the living and the yet unborn. In what words could this primigenius contract have been written?

Even apart from this, there are more possible critiques against language nationalism, for example that one may learn another language and even start thinking in it (in fact, I am writing this essay in a tongue that isn't my native), making all this linguistic nationalism generally a voluntary allegiance and thus not so far from civic nationalism.

*Bibliographical note*: I already have said how sorrowful is the unavailability of *Merchants and Heroes* in English, but fortunately I can share my passion for Sombart's thought and recommend some similar reading for those interested, first of all F. Von Hayek's assessment of Sombart and his comrades in [The Road to Serfdom](https://www.falseflag.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Road-to-Serfdom-F.A.-Hayek.pdf) (chapter 12)*,* not because I have the slightest respect for Hayek, but because it is almost the only source from where an English-speaking reader may hear at least something about this particular side of Sombart's work. Some of his books, however, were translated into English, most importantly [German Socialism](https://archive.org/details/sombartgermansocialism1937), a more serene reflection on the German Idea of the State written almost twenty years after *Merchants and Heroes*. Also, the ""comrades"" to whom I have alluded above, in fact, formed a school, which I call the ""*War Socialists*"", which also offers us much worthy material. Despite much of these ""war books"" was written specifically ""for Germans"", many such works were fortunately translated, like Spengler's [Prussianism and Socialism](http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/P%20Soc/Prussianism.Socialism.htm) (which, apart from a significant contribution to War Socialist thought, is a summary of Spengler's philosophy for those who find it tiresome to read the two volumes of *The Decay of the West* entirely), the somewhat more scientific, but still poetic [Three Years of World-Revolution](https://archive.org/details/threeyearsofworl00lensuoft), by Paul Lensch, and [The Third Reich](https://archive.org/details/Ge3rd), by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, which is a masterful recapitulation of key War Socialist themes, as well as the start of an even more vigorous movement called the *Conservative Revolution.* Inside this ""new conservatism"", the thought of [Ernst Niekisch](https://niekischtranslationproject.wordpress.com/) may be seen as an outgrowth of War Socialism, but Ernst Junger's work, especially [Total Mobilisation](https://anarchistwithoutcontent.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/junger-total-mobilization-doc.pdf), also repeats some of the War Socialist arguments in a new way. At last, for those who know German, separate works of the famous Swedish publicist [Rudolf Kjellén](https://archive.org/details/dieideenvoneine00kochgoog) and of [Eduard Stadtler](https://archive.org/search.php?query=eduard%20stadtler) are highly recommended.

**On Civic Nationalism**

One of the assessments I was given for the older version of this essay was an equation of my ideology with something that the critic called ""iliberal civic nationalism"". However, the form of nationalism for which I  am arguing here is opposed to civic nationalism and bourgeois constitutional patriotism in any form, be it liberal, progressive, conservative or authoritarian. I think the arguments put forward previously already could refute civic nationalism with its civil contract, ""daily plebiscite"", ""our democratic values"" and so on. When we stand before the State, we aren't looking at a mere association like those created by artisans in the old days, but at a majestic feat of the human mind, a ""great architectonic structure"", a ""hieroglyph of the reason which reveals itself in actuality"" (Hegel, [Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.htm#PR272), § 279, Addition) and at the spirit of an entire people embodied (Hegel, [Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#051), § 51). We also have already seen that this spirit includes also the dead and the yet unborn, and that there is no human language in which such a majestic contract may have been written, but to call it a ""contract"" at all can be done just as a metaphor, for the reasons already explained and for some others which we will adduce now.

The biggest argument against civic nationalism is that voluntaryism is a very weak ground to solve any such great questions. The will of men is very unstable, wanting one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, worshipping someone in the morning and killing him in the evening. Georg Simmel, [in another part](https://archive.org/details/sociologyofgeorg030082mbp/page/n95/mode/1up) of the quoted work, presents several examples of all this, not to say Le Bon and Taine. So, we might let the people decide whether we should build a bridge or maybe even questions of policy such as to declare a war (given that such an important question is already allowed to be raised by experienced men), but never to determine what is a nation, as, like we already have said, the lower classes aren't particularly suited to discuss philosophy. If, as some of the most elitist classical liberals directly or indirectly propose, someone tried to resolve this problem by giving freedom only to a few -- to those educated, rich and noble, who are considered enlightened enough to deserve this -- and letting them write these contracts and voluntarily create nations out of thin air, he would fall into a contradiction, for the will of these few is just a partial will as opposed to the general will of the nation. The nation encompasses *everybody* within it: the rich and the poor, the noble and the ignoble, the princes and paupers, the evil and the good. We have already explained this with more detail in the section dealing with cultural nationalism.

**The Relation of the State to Ethnicity**

Another proof that the application of this idealist view of the State to patriotic philosophy does not amount merely to an authoritarian form of civic nationalism is the crucial part played by ethnicity in it. Unfortunately, many reactionaries throughout history have degraded the State to such a level as to suppress a nascent sense of ethnicity  -- the only true form of nationalism -- and, conversely, others have abused the principle of ethnicity to rebel against the State's dignity, to promote vile materialism and capitalism and, at the end, to shame the idea of ethnicity itself. These two are the main errors we shall fight now.

As we have seen, the will of the State, also known as the general will, is the collective will of its members, and, therefore, the Idea of the State is the arithmetical mean of the spiritual characteristics of a people, known as its soul or general spirit, which is determined ""by the climate, the religion, the laws, the maxims of government, by precedents, morals and customs"" (Montesquieu, [The Spirit of Laws](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_Laws_(1758)/Book_XIX), Book XIX, Chapter IV). Some may accuse us of contradiction for citing this particular passage of Montesquieu, for it affirms that it is the State (""laws"" and ""maxims of government"") that determines the spirit of the nation, which would make it impossible for the State to be its embodiment, as that would confuse the cause and the effect, but it is completely logical to see the State as the actualisation of a people's spirit, for the State is the only definite form it can assume, being superior to culture in this aspect.

Now, the State -- and, therefore, the nation -- requires some inamovible principle to serve as its backbone. For the reasons already thoroughly discussed above, it cannot be either culture or language, while land -- preferred by cultural nationalism -- is outside man and thus cannot determine his essence, as we shall discuss in an Appendix. There also are some authors who, like the unhistorical individual from the [Preface](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm#xxvii) of Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*, who tries to ""leap out of his time or jump over Rhodes"", attempt to surpass common sense with their exalted ultra-idealism and to find this *arkhé* of patriotic philosophy in some kind of unfathomably metaphysical ""historical unity"" (this was the error José Ortega y Gasset and his famous disciple José Antonio Primo de Rivera committed) or even in spirit itself, like Spengler or, perhaps, also like the Russian Eurasianists and the immense variety of their vulgar imitators, who inhabit the pages of newspapers such as the infamous *Zavtra* and who fill with their nonsensical books so many ""patriotic"" publishing houses. These exaggerations are easy to refute if we understand their cyclical nature: the State itself is a historical unit, as it was seen by Hegel ([Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hi/history4.htm#051), § 41), which makes senseless the idea of putting a historical unit as its backbone, while the people's spirit is exactly what we are trying to determine here, so to refer to it again would be a tautology rather than an answer.

That answer which none of them could offer us was found long before them, even before Hegel, by Edmund Burke. In his popular [Reflections on the Revolution in France](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France), he said ""we wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers"", and ""...the parliament says to the king, 'Your subjects have inherited this freedom', claiming their franchises not on abstract principles 'as the rights of men', but as the rights of *Englishmen* \[my emphasis -- K. V\]...""; and ""in this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in *blood* \[my emphasis -- K. V\]..."": this is the great truth which our contemporaries lack the boldness to vindicate!

It is in ancestry, poetically speaking, in *blood,* where the spirit of the nation is seen, yet blood can scream only from the grave (Genesis, 4:10) and not so often appears in the life of a living man. Blood is inside men and inherent to every one of them (even if it is mixed, for the object of true nationalism is not absolute purity, but merely the prevailing element, while the existence of such pure elements is already implied in the proposition, so often thrown at us, that ""*everybody is mixed*"", in the same way as grey requires also the existence of black and white), though men cannot change it in their lifetime, making ethnicity immune to the excesses of voluntaryism mentioned above. This is how the main characteristics of an ethnic people, living under its own State, are represented in that State.

It was already said several times throughout this essay that the State represents the arithmetic mean of the qualities of all the people, which is also corroborated by Rousseau (""There is often a great deal of difference between the will of all and the general will; the latter considers only the common interest, while the former takes private interest into account, and is no more than a sum of particular wills: but take away from these same wills the pluses and minuses that cancel one another, and the general will remains as the sum of the differences"", [The Social Contract](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract/Book_II#3._Whether_The_General_Will_Is_Fallible), Book II, Chapter III) and by Hegel, who saw in the State the union of the particular and the universal ([Philosophy of Right](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR260), § 260). It is pointless, therefore, to look at separate persons inductively when inquiring into the people's soul, for in these cases, no matter how many separate individuals will we be able to review, we will surely miss the forest for the trees. It is long known that not all Spaniards are merry, not all Germans are industrious, not all Frenchmen are prideful and so on, but that doesn't deny that every nation has some specific spiritual characteristics. As the lines in Nasca, these characteristics are only seen from above, to be more exact, through something above them that would unite the particulars to make the universal. This is another error in Spengler's view of ""civilisations"": the variety (or absence) of philosophical views within a civilisation, without some outside authority to reduce this variety to the universal, will simply make these differences too great to tackle the influence of a single one of them in history. It might be responded to us that, in this case, culture, including the greatest works of art, will act as this kind of moderator of the civilisation's development. However, we have already stated that culture is merely a flow of individual achievements rather than a single whole as is the State, while to chose some of them as ""great"" or ""classical"" is merely a value judgement, and one which is forced upon us by an enormous institute of elitist academic criticism. Moreover, the philosopher (i.e. Spengler) himself has to interprete these works in such a way that he sees there his ""macrocosms"", which may or may not reflect the intentions of their respective authors, and then to force these macrocosms upon the entire nation, notwithstanding (this should be repeated over and over again) that each work of art is an *individual creation,* while the State, as the union of individual wills, is by definition *collective.*

We can conclude that it is in the State, understood as the apex of individual qualities and wills and most of all as the arithmetic mean of an ethnic people, where we see the best image of nationalism.

*Bibliographical note:* ""*Zavtra*"" is a Russian anti-Western newspaper, founded by Alexander Prokhanov in 1990. It follows a generally Stalinist line, though inside it exists a considerable variety of opinions.",,,

I've really grown to hate democracy, and the fact that our government (US) has done nothing to stop the waves of anarchist protests is disgusting to me. I believe a strong nation with a competent leader is the best political system. I am firmly anti-communist, and extremely wary of modernity. 

All that being said, there are two parts of Fascist/Traditionalist thinking that I think no matter what I can't get behind.

1. I am not, and will never be racist. I can't conceive of myself as hating other races even ironically. Race to me is only a product of skin color. I do not identify with my race (I am not even fully white), and  I just can't understand how anyone could. The only things that matter to me are individuals and their choices, and the State which creates order and stability. 
2. I do not believe in God or Christianity. Epistemologically I  cannot bring myself to believe in a supreme being with a plan for me. The world is too chaotic and cruel for that to be plausible. I also believe that Christianity is an inherently negative force in the world, especially in its current state. Christianity is at the root of the problem that corrupted the west, and I think the days where it had any redeeming qualities have passed. China is an example that religion is not necessary to creating a strong state and cultural harmony, as terrible as they are.",,,

Authoritarianism,Americans cant be fascist,"Hear me out, americans can't be Fascist and i will tell you why.
 First of all, Here i mean fascist as an American who is nationalistic for the nation of the united states, not white nationalists etcetera. 
Second of all, we need to understand the values of fascism and what it is:
Fascism is founded on Authoritarianism, Collectivism, nationalism, the union of nation &amp; state, idealism and corporatism (the economic fascist kind).
Now, the united states and the ""nation"" of the united states are founded on democratic values and libertarianism, freedom, capitalism, federalism, and individalism— so basically what's called a [""Civic Nation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism?wprov=sfla1).
Therefore, to be nationalistic for america you need to accept and embrace those values, right? But those values inherently go against fascism and fascism is inherently nationalistic. You get what i mean? To be an American Nationalist you need to embrace civic values, but fascism is inherently against those and fascism is, of course, very nationalistic.",,,

Had ties to many Russian anti-communist organisations and now functions in Russia itself, where a radical offshoot known as Union of Solidarists-Corporatists was founded in 2010.

РОВС: The main White Émigré group. It included the prominent philosopher Ivan Ilyin and was something like a government in exile. It now functions in Russia as a conservative patriotic society.

Authoritarianism,How Authoritarian would this be Auth enough for a monarchy I was going to ask a simple question but then it turned to this I personally am a constitutional monarchist I dont think a single person will always benefit the people so there should be unchangeable laws that prevent the monarch from doing certain things laws guarded by not only the public but also some of the best soldiers and highest technology possible When it comes to religion Im only against the abrahamic religions but wouldnt outlaw any of them Instead Paganism of various kinds would be promoted I am for free speech but the people should have no direct say in government I dont want innocent comedians to be taken to jail over an edgy joke Market should be free for the most part Some things like weapons medicine and utilities should be regulated by the government for the safety of the citizens When it comes to ownership of firearms pretty much anyone without an extreme mental disease can but one although the process would be long and easilyconcealed weapons should take much longer to get and the buyer must have proof that they absolutely need one Personally Im against spying on your own citizens and having incredibly high security everywhere but high security is a great way to keep people safe from any potential threats Small businesses should be prioritized and incentivized over large corporations at all times Along with that protection of the environment and wildlife should be a concern Theres no point in having anything if the world burns Finally the country should have mostly closed borders Tourism should be allowed but incredibly regulated Immigration into the country should be hard but not impossible depending on where the migrant is coming from Those coming from a place radically different from Iran to Sweden for example should not be allowed in And depending on the country should depend on what it trades and who it trades with and hopefully it would trade with neighbors but that is not always possible,"I was going to ask a simple question, but then it turned to this. 

I personally am a constitutional monarchist, I don’t think a single person will always benefit the people, so there should be unchangeable laws that prevent the monarch from doing certain things, laws guarded by not only the public but also some of the best soldiers and highest technology possible. 

When it comes to religion, I’m only against the abrahamic religions, but wouldn’t outlaw any of them. Instead, Paganism of various kinds would be promoted. 

I am for free speech, but the people should have no direct say in government. I don’t want innocent comedians to be taken to jail over an edgy joke. 

Market should be free, for the most part. Some things, like weapons, medicine, and utilities, should be regulated by the government for the safety of the citizens. 

When it comes to ownership of firearms, pretty much anyone without an extreme mental disease can but one, although the process would be long and easily-concealed weapons should take much longer to get and the buyer must have proof that they absolutely need one. 

Personally, I’m against spying on your own citizens and having incredibly high security everywhere, but high security is a great way to keep people safe from any potential threats. 

Small businesses should be prioritized and incentivized over large corporations at all times. Along with that, protection of the environment and wildlife should be a concern. There’s no point in having anything if the world burns. 

Finally, the country should have mostly closed borders. Tourism should be allowed, but incredibly regulated. Immigration into the country should be hard, but not impossible depending on where the migrant is coming from. Those coming from a place radically different (from Iran to Sweden, for example), should not be allowed in. And depending on the country should depend on what it trades and who it trades with, and hopefully it would trade with neighbors, but that is not always possible.",,,

Socially: I believe that the nation is for the people of said nations for example Italy belongs to Italians, France belongs to the French etc. but I believe that black Frenchmen e.g. 3rd generation immigrants at that point are as French as a white Frenchman, sort of like a culture thing. I believe Christianity in Europe should be placed above all other religions and whilst I am okay with Islam, Judaism etc. in my Ideal society they'd be strictly regulated and would not be allowed to work in Government or parliament/senate. LGBTQ people would not face prosecution but we would not teach children about it in Schools and other places of learning, same goes for Transgender people. 

Government: Here's the curve ball I believe in total freedom of speech, protest and journalism, however I do not believe that the general public should have a say in what happens to their country, sort of like the Roman Empire under a few Emperors.

Economically: Basically authoritarian capitalism simple as, capitalism ran by the state.

Social issues- I am opposed to transexuality and i think it should be banned, i am fine with homo and bisexuality tho. I am against abortion unless it is a non-european or the baby has a mental or sever physical disability. I want a nation with only Europeans in it.   


Government- I want governmental surveillance of everyone, everywhere at all times of the day (except for in the bathroom and such). I want the government to be able to impose what ever laws they want, when they want. I want the police to have military grade equipment and they should have a lot more power and protection than they currently do. Schools should teach to love the goverment. There should be a ban on ideologies shuch as communism, anarchism, libertarianism and liberalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Economy- i want the economy to be strictly controlled by the state, society would be organized into different areas of employment like military, agriculture, engineering, etc called corporations that the government assigenes people to your employment into these is designated by your interests and skills, then the government sets a goal like for example the production of 40,000 cars per month with the expectation the standard is met. I would want things like social wefare and puplic healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

Foreign policy- I hate interventionism, i want completely closed borders, a ethno-state. I am a pan-European. I want mono-culturalism. I want to avoid wars as much as possible.",,,

Hopefully some will see this and help me out.

Social Ideology - I'm a pretty (very) liberal person when it comes to social issues. Pro Gay marriage/rights and pro abortion, honestly I don't care who you have a relationship with or how many babies you abort as long as it's legal and doesn't affect me. 

Economic Ideology - I'm not as liberal when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Where I live healthcare is free, I support free healthcare for all. Other than that however, I want the government to spend less to keep our taxes low.

Government Ideology - I believe in an authoritarian government. I would make mass protests illegal, and crack down on anti-government press coverage and social groups. I would do this to stop the spread of political violence that seems to infect every crevice of western society today.

In conclusion, I support a authoritarian progressive conservative agenda... or at least I think that's what it would be called. Any help would be appreaciated as I'm in the middle of a political ideology crisis.",,,

I wanted to simply take a moment and, as an American celebrating Thanksgiving, go through why I’m happy to have found this community.

I’m a nerd, and I love studying different ideologies. I’ve commented here and there, and had a couple conversations here, but most of the time I just watch and learn. Irony being what it is, I really wouldn’t call myself an authoritarian by any real means, except when I go through the “if I were in charge of ____” rabbit hole.

Overall though, I enjoy learning about everybody’s different ideas and ideologies, even if my gut reaction to them is visceral hatred. Thank you all for being unabashed in your philosophy, for sticking to your guns, and having some very interesting ideas about government.

1.Never try to coup

I didn't really like the technocrats and the fake auths so i decided to go apeshit and ban you guys like a removed. I succeded but boy do I regret it. I'd do anything to have the old sub back

2. Name it some random sh1t: Name it like ahfanhraj or something and say its a private anti hate sub.

3. Don't be a dick to your auths: Yeah admin trust does nothing. I pretended to suck ahs cock for a month and they still banned it

4. NO reposts. 

I got no warnings from reddit and I was the only one who posted. It had to be an automatic action based off of my full tot reposts. If ya want some old memes I can dm them to you.

Yeah so I'm so sorry guys I f@cked up at least learn from my mistakes. Please feel free to re make the subs with these lessons.

Now, here is what I wanna say:

I think the ottoman empire should still be around here.

It kept the peace in the middle east, you know the headache he bri'ish had trying to solve the problems there after WW1 and if it kept the peace, the USA could do shit like worrying about their own people, not about we jews, this way solving a lot of problems, like solving the question : why in Discord we have 🅱️ and B, but with blue background, but not outside discord?",,,

But except for  the really crazily outrageous-most instances of this, there is more free-speech in an ultra-authoritan régime than there would be in an anarchic society ... because in an anarchic (in the sense of lacking _central_  governance) society, curb on free-speech will _emerge spontaneously_  through the struttings &amp; posturings of self-appointed 'mighty ones' who have the knack of cowing others, &amp; love cowing others, by their blusterings &amp; glowerings &amp; their making-out as though they are about to hit something ... &amp; this will set a curb at free-speech _far_  tighter than the curb _any_  central government - other than the _verymost_  extreme ones - _could possibly_  impose.

It's just exposing what has already existed. The U.S. has a ""Muh freedom and muh rights"" degenerate morality that doesn't emphasize sacrifice, honor, or moral duty to other people and now COVID19 has exposed this. A disease that doesn't seem to care about property rights doesn't seem to be complying the average American's libertarian ideology. You have issues getting people to even wear mask much less sacrifice any more serious inconveniences or hardships required to save lives. You also have a state that refuses to supply universal healthcare to it's citizens or sufficient financial relief. This coupled with the fact that almost all Americans have both parents working to pay the bills and have very little savings to support the bourgeois capitalists class living as parasites off it's workers.

Liberal capitalism which views people as individual work widgets and not members of larger nations of people has been importing millions of people from around the world. This has led to racial conflict that makes dealing with any other issue almost impossible.  We are witnessing the death of liberalism and it's probably going to take what's left of Western civilization with it. A proper authoritarian system needs to replace it.",,,

Authoritarianism,Final message from FULLTOTALITARIAN,"Two things:

1. **Alternative subreddits**  
Creating a FT alternative on Reddit is not going to work. Any subreddit looking to emulate or replace it will just get removed instantly without appeal. It doesn't matter if you follow the reddit rules by the letter, if your subreddit qualifies as a ""ban-evasion"" sub then it will just be banned as well.   
There are some splinter-communities outside of reddit that you can join. They're not run by the original mod team but you'll be with the same type of crowd. If you know of one of these communities, please do share them here in the comments.

2. **FULLTOTALITARIAN's ban explained**  
As you'll know there are two individuals running around claiming that they got the subreddit banned. Neither of those are directly responsible for it.  
The first is quartz_king. This is the retard that was mad he got banned because he couldn't spam the n-word. So to own the auths he wen't to AHS.  
The second is shyguystreams. This twerp reported the subreddit to the admins directly and thinks that he was responsible when it was banned later. He definitely wasn't the first, back in september I sent [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/7CiIEQj.png) to my pal on the mod team when the first person that reported it revealed themselves. Over the past month I've gotten countless of those messages. I don't know if shyguystreams is genuinely autistic or not but he's made ""getting the sub banned"" his entire personality now.  
Admins don't really care about individual reports, if there aren't many people reporting a subreddit it's either not very popular or those reports are false-positives. Once a certain threshold of reports is reached they actually take action. 

---

So, there is no contingency plan set up for trying to recreate the subreddit as ban-evasion is futile. If I ever make another subreddit it will be about something else, and probably with moderation turned up to eleven to ensure people follow the rules.

Try not to get banned until then.",,,

Authoritarianism,We have a goal With the fall of full totalitarian we now know that any sub we flee to will be shut down in a matter of time This is evident by the other subs people have been making in replacement thag have been shut down in a matter of hours or days This will happen with this sub to inevitably and likely soon They have likely tagged multiple of the users in both subs and are tracking them But that is not the pointWe do not need a sub to call home We have no home in this hell hole Nor do we need one to stay up for long All we need is a presence on reddit If we have that we can recruit more brethren to the causeIn order to have a presence on reddit with the monitoring of us the goal will not be to evade suspicion                        Instead the goal will be to recruit as many brethren as possible Thus gives us some freedom We can be more open in our beliefs As it doesnt matter what we say They will take it down Also It will draw in people that already agree with us and others that may still be on the fence Those we do recruit we will bring back to a second platform like discord There likely wont be one big server for all of us to plan in Instead we will be a web that communicates with one another all with the same goal To spread the word of our authoritarian beliefs,"With the fall of full totalitarian we now know that any sub we flee to will be shut down in a matter of time. This is evident by the other subs people have been making in replacement thag have been shut down in a matter of hours or days. This will happen with this sub to inevitably and likely soon. They have likely tagged multiple of the users in both subs and are tracking them. But that is not the point.

We do not need a sub to call home. We have no home in this hell hole. Nor do we need one to stay up for long. All we need is a presence on reddit. If we have that, we can recruit more brethren to the cause.

In order to have a presence on reddit with the monitoring of us the goal will not be to evade suspicion. 
       
                Instead the goal will be to recruit as many brethren as possible. Thus gives us some freedom. We can be more open in our beliefs. As it doesn't matter what we say. They will take it down. Also It will draw in people that already agree with us and others that may still be on the fence. Those we do recruit we will bring back to a second platform like discord.

Authoritarianism,Hello  Im a MestizoLatino national socialist Am I based,"My profile says it all. I aim to unite Latin America under a national socialist regime. Yes I know Latin America is too diverse and all but hear me out. I advocate for the following:

1. Pan-Latin Americanism. This is a type of pan-nationalism that seeks for a pan-ethnocultural unity of the Latino people. Race, religion, and language do not matter, but culture and ethnicity do. As long as you have ancestry in Latin America then you're welcome.

2. A state-directed economy, or state capitalism. Like Nazi Germany's economy, I believe at least 40% of the economy should be run by the state while 60% should be run by private businesses but monitored by the state. I believe private businesses should put the interests of the nation before their own interests. I also don't believe in 100% autarky (maybe 50% at least), but in mercantilism and protectionism.

3. Neopaganism. Yes, I'm basically a Latino Himmler. I believe in state-neopaganism and other beliefs should be abolished. I personally do not trust the Catholic church or the Pope. I believe in multiple supernatural powers instead of one. I believe we should bring back the primordial traditions of ancient civilizations, such as the Aztec and Inca empires, where they would dig someone's heart out in order to communicate with the gods.

I mention in part 1, that I believe that the governor should be elected indirectly. An electoral college should be convened five years before the incumbent's tenure in office is due to end. A good example that I would like to emulate is the 1958 French Presidental election. The President should be elected by a college of national, regional and local representatives, governors, mayors, judges, members of the civil services, religious leaders etc. 

Wherever possible representatives should act as delegates. Delegates should consult with citizens eligible to vote and in the manner of the US presidential caucuses direct their representatives to vote in a certain manner in the electoral college.

That leaves one thing left, where should the prospective candidates for the governorship come from. Looking at the current Chinese political system, I propose that there should be two-tiers of leadership at the national level which qualifies onself to becoming the governor one-day. 

1) A central committee consisting of experienced parliamentarians (head of committees etc), former governors, CEOs of major companies etc. 
2) A politburo consisting of nine members, including the current president. The remaining members would be selected from the central committee, they would be tasked to lead independent national agencies equivalent to the US's CIA, FBI, Central Bank, SEC etc.

Libertarian,Should men who are baby trapped have to pay child support,"For the uninitiated, [baby trapping](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Baby%20Trap&amp;amp=true) is typically when a woman lies to her sexual partner about being on birth control and purposefully becomes pregnant. I’m using baby trapping because it’s more common than it should be. This manipulation is effective, at least temporarily, because the father will often feel pressured by society to “do the right thing.” Regardless of what the man decides is the “right thing,” (including voluntarily over paying support) at any time either party can involve the court to oversee child support obligations and compliance.

If a man doesn’t want to be physically or financially connected to the mother of his child for the next 18 years, should they have a choice in the matter? I envision a contract between the potential parents where the man will pay for the woman’s abortion. If the woman does not want to have an abortion or commits to placing the baby up for adoption, she will be barred from seeking child support from the child’s biological father.

This is relevant to libertarianism because it is a scenario in which the state can and will send citizens to jail over an unpaid debt. Adding insult to injury, the potential father never agreed to assume the debt in the first place.

I currently work night shift and I carry chem lights (glow sticks) in my duty bag that I purchased with my own money.  I give them out to pedestrians who are wearing dark clothing so that they are more visible to drivers and less likely to get hit by a vehicle.  (especially shortly after the bars close and there are a higher number of intoxicated drivers on the road.)

The Dairy Queen in my town gives us free ice cream coupons to give to kids who we see riding bikes with a helmet on.  On nice evenings when there aren’t calls to respond to I drive through the parks and hand them out.

When I see someone has a headlight out I’ll pull up next to them at a stoplight and roll down the window to let them know.  Most people don’t even know about it.  By doing it this way I don’t have to unnecessarily detain them by doing a traffic stop.

During slow nights I’ll hang out with the paramedics and EMTs at the ambulance garage and practice first aid tasks like putting on tourniquets.  Since I’m out on the road I get to calls before the ambulance 90% of the time and I’ve been able to give appropriate medical aid to injured people on several occasions.

They always say that if givernment didn't create the public education system, sure, it might be great for a large portion of the population. Those who can afford it.

But those at the bottom, will never go to school. Or so they say. I don't know if there's really any truth to that.

But I would think about that a lot. Regardless of whether it's true or not.

But today I realized, that there's a TON of kids, who may be going to a physical school, or were before Corona. And they had LESS of an education if they didn't go to school at all.

And supposedly, it's like this in pockets of the US across the board. There are areas where even though public education is free, it isn't doing anything. Because the schools are trash. Teachers don't want to even go to work because they work in a district full of violent nihilistic kids.

It's amazing how they fear for the plight of those at the bottom. And yet here we are today spending oh so much on schools. And we know the problem is not funding. Even the liberals admit that.

Second hypothetical, if an employee posts something on Facebook saying “vote Bob Smith, he will raise taxes on the rich”.  And their employer fires this person because that employer does not want their taxes raised. At what point do we, as the public, say an employer cannot fire an employee for off the clock actions?

Edit: I would like to clarify my position. I believe that there are things a person can do while off the clock to be fired. An example is being a member of the terrorist origination known as the KKK, [this racist wedding guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfR23SiBcv0)

The historical method has been to subsidize nuclear energy, since installing and maintaining plants is very expensive. No private corporation alone can maintain a profitable nuclear power plant.

That being said, there is a paradox for this sub, because one of its defining beliefs is that taxation is either immoral or a necessary evil, so raising taxes to pay for nuclear energy would not be very popular on this sub.

Say what you will about the anti-nuclear movement (and I have a lot to say), but one thing they correctly point out is that nuclear is far more expensive than traditional coal or natural gas, and solar and wind are much cheaper.

**In short: How should we pay for nuclear energy? If the public sector should pay for it (at least in part) how should that be done?**

Corpratacricies are bad mkay, as tyrannical as any government, worse even as they make the rules.

Centralized power is a necessary evil in order to preserve overall liberties and the common interest.

There is so much more to list, I'm not going to. I'll just say that those are some of the reasons for the way the federal Constitution is written.

I argue that the division of powers we enjoy has kept us from a very narrowly missed future of death and oppression from many real threats.

Franklin’s quote, “I am for doing good to the poor, but… I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth, I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, in the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.” Quite the take away.

Libertarian,Why in Gods name are there so many liberals on this sub,"If you're liberal, please go find another sub to pollute.

Libertarianism in the American context has its heart and soul deeply rooted in conservatism. The old right that opposed FDR's economic policies and foreign interventionism before the neocons took over.  We are pro second amendment, unconditionally. We oppose taxes of all kinds. Government buearacracies that you cherish and deem to be a part of everyday life we abhor and want nothing more than the total abolition of. Examples include the TSA, NSA, FDA, Board of ED, etc.  We don't just want to slash taxes, we want to cut spending as well. Many of us also want a legalization of alternative currencies like gold.

We do not look to people like Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky as shining examples who espouse our ideas. Instead we look to figures like Ron Paul and FA Hayek.

The fact that these statements could be a source of contention in this sub proves my point. If you disagree with the above, what are you doing here?

Let's go brandon, etc.

I was torn between quitting my job, starting a business and remaining unvaxxed, or selling out and getting the jab. I've recently applied to become a foster dad, so being unemployed will fuck that process up. With that being said, I'm getting vaxxed. Not for the ""greater good"" bullshit, but for the greater good of a kid in need of a home. Hopefully the vaccination is safe long term. Guess we'll roll the dice!

But the problem remains that I feel like I'm still part of the problem. So the way I'm going to live with myself, and I encourage you to do the same, is this:

Get vaccinated if you need to keep your job. But DO NOT act vaccinated the second your profession isn't at play. Never show a vaccination card to get into a plane, theater, restaurant, bar. Let the businesses who comply (whether through by force or choice) take the revenue hit. Boycotts are the only way this country gets the message.

I find these posts calling for libertarian purity (frankly) retarded, and counterintuitive to promoting a libertarian framework.**

Look, I'm not going to pretend to be some *died-in-the-wool Libertarian with a capital-L*, but I believe in freedom &amp; individualism as core political values, and as an American, I support capitalism and freedom of expression. I also know there are plenty of progressives and conservatives who feel the same way (albeit in different ways and to different degrees).

However, I don't blame them for being genuinely confused by some of the policies and ideas the LP and Libertarians broadly have put forward (abolishing public education, isolationism, abolishing all energy subsidies yet paying for expensive nuclear power (somehow?), etc).

Sure, progressives and conservatives on this sub may be more friendly to using government to solve problems, but that doesn't mean we should dismiss them or their arguments. Unless we become a literal ancap party, we need the government to do *something*, ideally in a limited capacity.

I can reassure at least some of you with the knowledge that most LP voters and supporters (like myself) aren't nearly this radical, and indeed many libertarians are practically-speaking centrists with libertarian values. That's not how the LP party establishment or the vocal ancaps operate, however, and they are the most vocal on this sub.

So to any fellow classical liberals or libertarians, who want to elect more libertarian statesmen and implement some libertarian policies, I encourage you to engage in self-criticism. One of the great feats of any human being is to know enough about a subject to *know* you are right, and that includes things like politics and economics.

It was a race that was a referendum on Biden due to his poor handling of the economy and his failed promises on post Covid-19 normalcy. It was a referendum on race politics and wokeism. Majority of Americans don’t go through their daily lives worrying about race and genuinely believe in America’s “meritocracy”. It was a referendum on the left’s stance on public education and CRT. Parents absolutely want a say in what their child is taught in public schools when their tax payer dollars is coming out of their pockets. Virginia broke for Biden in 2020 but due to the state of education and the economy, both big issues in the state, they broke for Youngkin.

Democrats have absolutely awful messaging. If they reject wokeism and run campaigns based on actual policies, they would fair better. At the end of the day, culture war is a huge reason why millions of Americans vote and why the right could be favorable in the future. The Republicans need to reject Trumpism and the cult of personality and they might see a red Tsunami for the midterms.",Discussion,-192.09,106.6

There is no mandatory association [in public sector unions]. *Janus* (5-4) overturned *Abood* (9-0).

And I don't agree with your other stated views on public sector unions.

You have said ""they don't bargain against the employer, they bargain against the taxpayers."" Only this isn't *really* true. Public sector workers bargain mostly against the top financial manager(s) employed by that public entity and the political priorities of the politicians in authority in the context of the budget the financial manager(s) present to them.

The financial manager(s) look at projected revenue, expenses, and market conditions to establish and recommend their view on what salaries can/should be. They are just like the financial arm of any company making similar decisions. They don't always get it perfectly right.

At the end of the day, public sector wages are generally *much lower* than their private sector counterparts. The historical tradeoff was positive feelings about public service, job stability, and some benefits (since the 80s and we've had a race to the bottom in not having pensions as demographic changes make them more expensive as well).

However, that's just negotiations on wages, which might only happen every few years. In the interim, unions do all sorts of representation for public employees that has clearly nothing to do with ""negotiating against the taxpayer"" except by the largest stretch of the imagination.

Things like ensuring fair application of discipline, improving workplace policies (often to better efficiency than would otherwise occur), improved or enhanced worker safety, navigating the ADA process, dealing with harassment/discrimination, and a whole host of other representational needs occur on the day-to-day basis as the real bread and butter of what unions do. These things are all very clearly based in the employer-employee relationship in a way that doesn't involve the taxpayer *at all* except by the most tangential understanding.

Very often, unions act as an additional Human Resources-type apparatus, paid for by employees themselves, and can serve to avoid costly litigation for the employer (and the public). Frequently, policies can be made better and more efficient by having input of staff who actually do the job rather than by some manager in their office with what they think is a brilliant idea. In many ways, unions can actually *save* the employer (public) money and make services better.

And back to the first part, in regards to agency shop-type provisions, what you see as mandatory association, I wonder if you wouldn't also be the first person to say,  ""this is what the employer will pay you, if you don't like it, go somewhere else, that's how the free market works."" Why wouldn't that extend to companies who've made such an agency shop agreement with their workforce? It would simply be one of the conditions of employment and you could choose to work there or not. It should be viewed essentially as part of your benefits package (which you contribute to through your salary by wages just like health insurance but is more than worth it by all statistical measures I've seen) when taking the job.",Discussion,-474.6,213.1

Do you believe reality now is comparable to the worlds depicted in these novels. Or ones not mentioned.  Would these novels be classified as Cyberpunk? I tend to call them dystopian. I don’t know if that’s what you actually call the genre. Or sub genre of Scifi. Or in some cases maybe proto-scifi.

If so…. What do you think makes reality like those books.

If reality does mimic fiction it may do so poorly. So, you don’t have to be super literal. Their are no firemen arriving to burn books. Or robot dogs  (or robot spider dogs that inject drugs into people) chasing you down. Or etc.

It becomes in your best interest to destroy others.

Social security is particularly nasty because it makes younger people hate older people. The sooner older people die, the better, because you will be paying higher taxes to support them the longer that they live.

In socialized healthcare, being sick is far more expensive than being dead. Expensive treatments should never be pursued, because you will be paying for the treatment of others. You will be incentivized to try to ensure they will die. Otherwise, you're penalized by the government.

With all of these programs, the government puts a gun to your head financially, and tells you, ""we're not telling you to murder anyone, but if you don't - we will kill you as a penalty."" On the massive scale of a large population, the tax pressure really creates a web of nasty incentives. The fabric of society and culture is destroyed.

My friends are either stated conservative or liberal. I share views on both sides. I find everyone a little crazy and generally feel like people on both sides need to get out of their own respective echo chambers.

In November 2020, after Biden was declared winner, many conservative friends proclaimed that A) the election was rigged B) Republicans would never win again C) America as we know it is over D) America will turn socialist E) Joe Biden is going to Defund the Police...amongst many other things.

They could not come to grips with the fact that 7 million more people were just flat-out sick of Donald Trump as the leader of our country. I got into many arguments with them because I could not understand how they did not comprehend that losing a political election in America does not mean we are doomed for eternity. The beauty of our democracy is that we get to vote again in a couple of years.

Fast-forward to last night. There was speculation that Virginia's Governor position could be a tight race. I saw a lot of people on Twitter saying things like ""*Let me guess, Republicans will be in the lead until midnight and the votes will magically switch to blue*"", insinuating that the election will be rigged. Well, Virginia just voted in a Republican governor. Conservatives quickly forgot their ""elections are rigged"" and ""we'll never win another election"" stances and switched to ""This is what happens when you GO WOKE!"". In the span of a few hours.....just completely abandoned their year-long stance of rigged elections.

Democrats seem like they are trying to rationalize what happened. Some more moderate outlets are suggesting that this should be a warning sign due to National Dem's inactions. Others are saying that the Dem loss was a result of RACISM! Others are saying ""OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN PERIL""!

So, in the span of a year with Joe Biden as president, a 15 point swing worth of white women in Virginia have all turned racist and now vote conservative? I don't buy it.

Maybe people were just sick of the incumbent? Maybe Virginia's voters were turned off by some of the incumbent's policies and were sick of his anti-Trump campaign? I'm sure many factors were involved...but for some people on the left to suggest that it's due to racism is simply idiotic. The same way people on the right (albeit, much more prominent people) claimed that elections are rigged.

Oh, and Minneapolis voted to keep their current police structure last night. They didn't ""defund the police""

America has elections. Some people win, some people lose. Some people get mad and some get excited. Others don't care. Win or lose, people try to rationalize it and spin it in ways that strike nerves in people. Life moves on. Rinse and repeat.

Libertarian,Youngkins win is a win for classical liberalism,"I say this as someone who wouldn't vote for a party that's actively trying to undermine democracy and overturn elections if my life depended on it, but I can't agree with the mainstream narrative that racist white backlash is the primary cause of what happened in VA.  College educated white women stuck with Democrats because the anti-democratic movement supercedes other concerns, but the rest of the centrist electorate is always fickle and focused on their feelings.

Telling them CRT isn't taught in schools is true, but banning CRT wasn't the idea that drove their vote, it was the *feeling*.  The feeling wasn't, ""Why are my kids being taught CRT?"" It was anger at months of remote schooling, attempts to end merit-based education, and implement curriculum that highlights equity of outcomes over equality of opportunity/meritocracy. The vast majority of Gen-X and Millenials were raised on classical liberal philosophy (Jefferson, Rawls, not the crazy racist definition of classical liberalism that dominates libertarian circles) that emphasize equality of rights and equal opportunity. Democrats would do well to remember that, stop all racism attacks, and embrace small-L liberalism.

Recently saw a documentary about genetic engineering, realized we are on the brink of a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in science regarding genetic engineering.

The CRISPR molecule can be used with pinpoint precision to edit any gene in your body. Eventually you’ll be able to change any genetically-based feature of your body from disease to appearance. The biggest part is that this technology is accessible to all people because it is so cheap and simple to use.

Obviously it’s a good thing that we have found a way to cure once incurable diseases, and it can be debated whether or not it’s a good thing to be able to edit your phenotypes. But there is a bigger dilemma to be discussed:  the CRISPR molecule works just as well on basically every living organism. Anyone can edit the genome of an animal and release that animal into the wild where the natural evolution of all animals will be permanently changed.

This isn’t science fiction either. There is already a team of bioengineers that have edited the genome of mice to kill ticks that bite them thus stopping the transmission of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses which have wrecked havoc on ecosystems that have warmed up and allowed ticks to thrive in areas they were never apart of before global warming.

Clearly it’s a good idea to try and stop the epidemic of tick-borne illnesses, but is it a good idea to permanently edit the genome of a mouse that will then pass their genes on and eventually change the course of evolution?

And what if someone does this on their own without oversight? How would we control the possibility of anyone being able to permanently alter evolution? What if this technology is used maliciously to edit the genome of animal that could actually spread more disease to an adversarial nation?

I’ve got so many questions, and no answers. And the biggest problem is that it seems like no one has the right answer because we’ve never been faced with this dilemma in the entirety of human history. So what are your thoughts on this situation?",Discussion,-318.29,153.0

1. willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.
2. relating to or denoting a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise.

The same root, Liber-, meaning 'free', is a recipe for the words Liberal and Libertarian. Now, the nuance or argument between the two may be in the scope, role, and process of the state, but the aim is shared: maximum freedom and opportunity for all.

If you hate liberals, you cannot call yourself a libertarian. You are fascist. No freedom-loving person would hate another freedom-loving person. You might argue over how best to maximize freedom; but you won't perceive them as an enemy. Liberals and libertarians share the aim of bringing forth freedom in society from the dark pits of ignorant theocracy, hierarchy and oppression.

If you hate those who love freedom, you are a fascist. You may be confused by the word play of modern propagandists like Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, and others who openly admire with their words and emulate with their work the fascists of the last century.

We constantly hear that traffic stops are horribly dangerous, hence cops have to be on alert, and prompt compliance (under penalty of death) is mandator for all citizens.

But that's a lie.  A cop's risk of dying in a traffic stop is one in 3.6 million.  It's riskier to ride a horse.

&gt;Dozens of encounters appeared to turn on what criminologists describe as [officer-created jeopardy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/30/video/police-traffic-stops-danger-video.html): Officers regularly — and unnecessarily — placed themselves in danger by standing in front of fleeing vehicles or reaching inside car windows, then fired their weapons in what they later said was self-defense. Frequently, officers also appeared to exaggerate the threat.
&gt;
&gt;In many cases, local police officers, state troopers or sheriff’s deputies responded with outsize aggression to disrespect or disobedience — a driver talking back, revving an engine or refusing to get out of a car, what officers sometimes call “contempt of cop.”

Libertarian,The contents of the audit results of the Election Audit in Maricopa County,"The liberals and the liberal media claim that the 2020 presidential election was the most secure election in human history. They claim that election fraud is a Qanon conspiracy theory and dangerous to our democracy and racist nazi domestic terrorist hate speech and this and that.

But I know there are at least some real libertarians here who dont believe in the fake news and know there was wide spread election fraud for the last US presidential elections. Its kinda obvious.

Here is a video of the contents of the election fraud results for Maricopa County. Note the video starts at 1:24:31 where they show obvious evidence of fraud.

The Video is a little long and dry but I thought I summarized a few things they found:

* There were a lot of duplicate serial numbers for the ballot batches. Meaning they was a lot of copies of these ballots which makes them illegitimate...

* The Ballots use a circle and a cross marker that is suppose to align with eachother when you over lap them to make sure ballots are legitimate. They found a lot of circle and cross markers that were not align which means a lot of ballots were illegitimate. They show pictures of this in the video.

* Maricopa County uses a certain thick paper. Also called VoteSecure Paper with special coating. But they found a lot of ballots with a lot of thin paper stock where they was a lot of bleed through.

* Maricopa Country Staff organization made it very difficult to work with the auditors. They refused to answer questions and refused to let the auditors inspect the voting machines.

If you google AZ audit findings youll find articles that say ""They hand recounted all X00,000 ballots and proved again that Biden won by X0,000..."". The part they dont say is that the recounted all ballots including the fake ones. Thats what the liberal media is going with.

No doubt a lot of so called ""libertarians"" here are going to quickly jump to Biden's defense. Cause to them its so obvious that Biden easily got 81 million votes...  Whereas a reasonable person would support a transparent election audit for all states.

It really blows my mind how the ""libertarians"" here are Biden supporters. Biden is fucking this country in the ass with inflation and vaccine mandates just to name a few examples yet they love deep throating that Biden cock. They forgot that Hillary/DNC cheated them over during the democratic primaries of 2016 when Bernie won but was cheated by Hillary and the DNC. They are soo dumb that they forgot that and voted democrat for 2020. And now we have the lamest president in US history...  Thxc Democratic voters! Lets Go Brandon!

I mean I’ve heard that get tossed around for awhile now.  I’m not gonna say “peaceful” divorce. Ideally I’d it had to happen I’d prefer there not to be a hot conflict. But, there probably would be.

Me. I’m not entirely sure if liberals/progressives and conservatives can or should continue to try and “coexist “ in the same country along side each other.

Can two completely opposing cultures exist parallel to each other under the same government. I don’t think so. Atleast not anymore it seems.

If America split into two or even 4 countries how would that look? Should each group be given an opportunity to draft a state and people who agree with the groups politics or economics could just move there.

Or should one side disappear? I don’t know how exactly you to that ethically though. I don’t think you do.  I don’t think hey let’s put the right or left in jail or re-education camps would fly well.

Libertarian,Unpopular opinion Blue Lives Matter is not inconsistent with Libertarianism,"I frequently see libertarians make fun of those that pair the 'back the blue' flag with the Gadsen flag, as if they're inconsistent. I don't buy this. There are two reasons supporting the police is good and promotes libertarian values:

First, a minimal government is useful for promoting property rights. If you believe that, then there's a prima facie reason to have police, as those are the ones who enforce those legal rights.

Second is because of the paradox of freedom (sometimes called the paradox of liberalism, in the classical sense of 'liberalism'). Unlimited freedom for everyone would potentially limit the freedom of some individuals, since those who would kill, assault, kidnap, or steal from others limits the freedom of those others. For that reason, self-defense is warranted (this is the underlying philosophy behind the NAP). Having police that respond to crimes is a protracted form of self-defense, or the defense of others, which is perfectly justifiable.

Having police is not inherently authoritarian, when they are limited to only enforcing true violations of the NAP. The real problem boils down to nanny-ish laws and occasional police overreach, but there's a notable anti-police bias in the media. People end up thinking that American officers are way worse than they actually are. [This podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmgxtcbc4iU) by Sam Harris does a good job of correcting that bias.

This isn't to say that there aren't bad officers or bad practices among police that could be improved. Nor is it to say that Blue Lives Matter is the best way of supporting police (a particularly bad idea being classifying killings of police as hate crimes). There are some genuinely good suggestions about how to improve policing ([this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL1cKKTeOsI) where Harris interviews Rener Gracie describes using jujitsu training to reduce injuries to civilians and officers and save money on workman's comp).

But there's nothing inherently contradictory in wanting a limited state and valuing the men and women in blue. Proper policing is one method of attaining a free people, and if we castigate those who like that method we're just going to alienate potential allies.",Politics,2.11,15.5

At one point, he was right.

A religious institution is no different in it's end goal than any other. Every entity seeks to survive and thrive. That is the nature of existence.

However, Marx was wrong in his sentiment. Has it not been the State which has replaced religion in it's first-seat of social importance? Has it not been the State to intrude into the lives of average people, in the same way religion has, or potentially to an even greater degree?

It seems apparent that, where once people believed in the ""sovereignty and wholeness"" of religious institutions, people now believe in the ""sovereignty and wholeness"" of the State. Dedication or loyalty to either may prove to be disheartening.

It is no longer religion which pacifies the average person. It is the State.

It is no longer religion which seeks to manage the life of the individual. It is the State.

In the same way early atheists shunned religious acts of barbarism in order to ""save"" souls, we must now shun the notion that the State won't commit equally heinous acts to serve the ""common good"", which ultimately serves State actors more than anyone else.

First let me say there are some situations where worker unionization is great. If you look back to the early days of unions in post-industrial Europe and the Gilded Age you can clearly say it was something that *needed* to be done. It was necessary, heroic and quite extraordinary. Workers under Carnegie and Rockefeller were legitimate heroes. After years of taking 30 second moldy sandwich lunch breaks and pissing in their breeches on the assembly line, they got workers compensation when they cut off a toe or choked out from an asbestos shower.

The main takeaway here is that initially unionization was meant to defend workers 'rights' that were earned; namely safety standards, ethical obligations and salary protections. The dignity of the employee. Unions were never created to coerce companies into providing suitable ""living wages"", to extort members into mandatory fees and contributions or influence political systems. But that's what happened.

Enter - the Nazi party and Soviet party. Both authoritarian, coercive and genocidal political entities that were born of, you guessed it, post-industrial 'worker's unions'...that ended up killing most of the people they started off defending. Ironic, isn't it?

Nowadays in modern, first world nations unions are almost *entirely* useless. Why? Because not only have the basic fundamental worker rights that were established decades ago remain, they have been expanded on to a degree, in law, that makes operating a business considerably more difficult than simply 'working' for the government. In the United States, more than 50% of all jobs are public or directly funded from a public source. Imagine that...half (or more) of commerce in the most 'Capitalist' nation on Earth is not even privately generated. Now imagine, in a hyper-international market where jobs are already outsourced for pennies in profit, what would happen if a union came into play and demanded to control wages? Sayonara jobs.

American corporations don't need loyal workers, they need compliant workers. And the whole world is at their finger tips, unlike in the 20s and 30s. When Americans are demanding a $15 an hour ""living wage"" (lol) to work, hundreds of thousands across the pond will do the job for $5.

Just like public ""socialized"" healthcare, unionization is a bandage, not a cure. ""Free"" healthcare doesn't make people healthy, that starts with healthy choices on the part of individuals and mitigating factors that induce bad health - most of those factors in the United States are caused by the corporations themselves (fast food, plastic, pesticides, sedentarism , radiation, pharmaceutical abuse). Just like unions forcing companies to pay more and offer more benefits doesn't improve workers quality of life, it just eliminates it as their job disappears.

So many of these trending proposed social programs are bandages...really, really shitty bandages, for a problem with deep roots.",Economics,-415.73,190.5

Libertarian,How I imagine Libertarian taxes A land value tax voluntary use based taxes and donations,"TL; DR -  For mandatory taxes, it should be a 1.5% land value military tax, and $121 a year per adult for basic national security taxes. Police, fire, and other services could be decided on at the local level. There should also be a US debt tax of $300-$400/month to get rid of the US national debt over the next 100 years.

I feel that our current tax system is unfair. With my paychecks as a lower middle class person, I am forced to pay city tax, state tax, federal income tax, and social security/medicaid. I also pay indirect taxes such as gas taxes, when I buy imports I also indirectly pay import tariffs. I also pay sales taxes on things.

Here's my ideal dream tax code at a basic level, but it's not exhaustive on how things get funded:

1. For military spending, I would hope the USA phases military spending to simply half of what we spend now over the course of a decade, that should be enough to keep us secure from external threats. Waste in the military should go down. I'm aware that the cons of cutting military spending is that 100s of thousands of jobs would get cut, simply because demand dropped 50%. Currently the US military spending is $750,000,000,000 dollars. The new budget would be $375,000,000,000 dollars. Source [https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/1782623/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2020-budget-proposal/](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/1782623/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2020-budget-proposal/)

Now the USAs real estate market is worth 27.2 Trillion dollars ($27,200,000,000,000). The taxation should be a simply formula, that would be $375B/$27.2T or basically a 1.38% military tax on real estate value. Now economics 101 dictates that when the price of something goes up, demand goes down. Maybe this would lower real estate demand and make the tax rate basically 1.5% for the military tax. Say a house is worth $300,000. With a 1.5% military tax, the military tax would be $4,500 or $375/month for the US military for that house. If you own a shack for a house (say a $100,000 house), your military tax would be $1,500 a year, or $125/month. I would say this is the fairest way to fund the military, those with real estate to protect from wars, pay the tax. The tax is passed onto renters and those who use real estate.

For environmental conservation, the US EPA spends $9.24 billion dollars a year on environmental protection. For National Park Services which conserves the environment, they spend around $4 billion a year on wildlife conservation (source: [https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/budget.htm](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/budget.htm)) . The CDC has an annual budget of 11.1 Billion dollars (source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers\_for\_Disease\_Control\_and\_Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention)). Because these agencies benefit everyone, not just real estate owners, anyone who is a taxpayer should have to pay for these services. Since 76% of the US population is over 18 years old, this comes down to basically 251 Million people. Now granted, just like how not everyone pays car insurance, not everyone will pay taxes, if just 80% of people pay this tax, then it would come down to basically $121/year per person.

&amp;#x200B;

The elephant in the room is the US national debt. The US national debt stands at a scary 29 Trillion dollars ([https://usdebtclock.org/](https://usdebtclock.org/)). I think that for us Americans to hold true to our debt obligations, we should start gradually paying down the US national debt. If I could impose a US national debt tax, it would apply to all US adults. So out of 251 million people, the debt should be paid down with the principle being eaten away. If 70% of every American adult paid a debt tax of $400/month, the US national debt would go down and we could get rid of our US national debt in a century. Imagine if our US debt balance is $0?, we would be in total economic prosperity.

&amp;#x200B;

For use based taxes, my example would be public roadways. Want a license and registration?, pay the road tax of the total cost of US roads divided by the number of licensed drivers.

I'm going to discuss my libertarian angle on why voluntary taxes are the way to go. If you agree that people should have the right to vote for whose in power, then people should be allowed to vote for how to finance the power. What I mean by that is how is it democratic to have the government enforce taxes on people that they don't consent to?

Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to have a condensed, and an expanded ballot where people can vote whether or not to fund something with their money?

The immediate problems this system would solve are the following. The first thing is that in a voluntary tax society, the rich couldn't actually weasel out of paying their taxes. If a rich person wants to use the roads, use civic services, have military protection, etc, the rich must pay their taxes. This is because their taxes to pay would be tied to their identity.

 Not a shell company, not an offshore account, determining if taxes are paid is as simple as ""Did Bill Gates pay his road taxes?"". Instead of Microsoft paying $0 in taxes, Bill Gates would be obligated to pay let's say $2,000 on the road taxes.

Now granted, their effective tax rate would be stupid small. Maybe like a 0.00001% tax rate, but at least there wouldn't be any tax loopholes to pay $0 in taxes. Also tax enforcement seems easier, rather than the IRS saying ""Is XYZ income legitimate, did they make a profit, is their accounting correct?"" Yada yada. The new IRS question would be as simple as ""Did Bill Gates pay his road tax on his driver's license?"" If not, license suspended and back fees must be paid with fines.

Another thing I love about voluntary taxes are if you don't like a government service, you just stop paying for said service. I know a big caveat to this idea is the US military. How do you quantify the value of the military? Well, maybe a land value tax funds the military. Want the luxury of land ownership protected by the military?, Then pay the military budget proportional to land value divided by total US land value.

Example: $100 billion dollar military budget, a landowner owns land 1/100 millionth the value of the USA'S land, the tax bill is $1000 a year. Even renters would be indirectly paying the price of land protected due to the landowner passing the costs onto the tenet.

The other benefit is it's a real democracy, we don't have real voting rights until we can decide how we wish to fund our government. Another benefit is if someone wants an expensive government funding of something, it has to be financed by the people. Rather than raising the National debt at already 28 trillion dollars ($28,000,000,000,000), why don't people only vote to finance something they can actually afford to finance. If a national debt must be levied, the taxpayers voting in favor of it must pay back the bonds for that project.

I also feel it reduces waste since people would likely only vote for taxes they deem necessary for society, rather than constant pork in budget bills.

He has a number of very poor nephews and nieces. He has been working with a charity organization to help them, but the organization needs more funding. So Sam goes out and starts demanding money from his neighbors to give to the charity group. If anyone refuses to contribute, Sam kidnaps that person and locks them in a cage.

Though charitable giving is laudable, as is the effort to care for one’s nephews and nieces, almost everyone who hears this story finds Sam’s extortion program impermissible. This includes both Democrats and Republicans, people who believe in a personal moral obligation to donate to charity, and even people who have a theory of “distributive justice” that says the current distribution of wealth in our society is unjust because the poor have too little.

Interestingly, however, many of the people who agree on the impermissibility of Sam’s behavior nevertheless support seemingly analogous behavior on the part of a certain other Uncle Sam. Some think it not only permissible but *obligatory* for the state to coercively seize funds to aid the poor.

This is just one of many activities of government that are generally accepted despite the fact that seemingly analogous behavior would be widely condemned if carried out by anyone else.

Libertarian,Do you believe in the concept of posetive liberty And can it ever outweigh a loss of negative libertyFor those who dont know posetive liberty is your right to do something rather than your right to not have something done to you Simple example Youre stuck alone in the middle of an desert and will die of dehydration Your negative rights are through the roof since nobody is around to infringe on them but your posetive rights are really low because youll die and you have no choice about itTo give a more concrete question to answer we can create three scenarios The first one is the one above youll die The second one is that someone is offering to sell you food and water but you have to work for them for the rest of your life becoming an indentured servant The third one is that the guy gives you the food and water no strings attatched and youre just a normal person afterwardsIs there any difference in the amount of freedom you have in each scenarioThen we can have another type of scenario one in which taxation exists but its only one dollar over your lifetime but you dont have to worry about dying in the desert Would you say youre more or less free in this scenario or the indentured servitude one Are you more free if you can choose between slavery and death or choosing between insignificant taxation and jail,"And can it ever outweigh a loss of negative liberty?

For those who don't know, posetive liberty is your right to do something rather than your right to not have something done to you. Simple example: You're stuck alone in the middle of an desert and will die of dehydration. Your negative rights are through the roof since nobody is around to infringe on them but your posetive rights are really low because you'll die and you have no choice about it.

To give a more concrete question to answer we can create three scenarios. The first one is the one above, you'll die. The second one is that someone is offering to sell you food and water but you have to work for them for the rest of your life, becoming an indentured servant. The third one is that the guy gives you the food and water no strings attatched and you're just a normal person afterwards.

Is there any difference in the amount of freedom you have in each scenario?

Then we can have another type of scenario, one in which taxation exists but it's only one dollar over your lifetime but you don't have to worry about dying in the desert. Would you say you're more or less free in this scenario or the indentured servitude one? Are you more free if you can choose between slavery and death or choosing between insignificant taxation and jail?",Philosophy,-159.27,96.1

What our country needs to do is we need to pay an average tax of $300/month per person to pay down the US national debt. If the USA kept paying down the national debt at $300/month per person, the USA would have no national debt in 100 years. To me this seems like a great way to end the US national debt and get rid of it once and for all. If the USA doesn't pay down it's national debt, I'm afraid we might end up like Venezuela and have a collapsed society.

Debt figure source: [https://usdebtclock.org/](https://usdebtclock.org/)

The USA's debt interest is about $562 Billion dollars a year. $300/month for 251 million American adults is $903.6 Billion dollars a year. $903.6 Billion/year-562 billion dollars a year is a net positive of  341.6 Billion dollars a year. With a $29T dollar debt, it would actually only take

If you are someone who cares about both cases, please read this:

American politics is heavily divided and we're past the point of people being killed. Two major examples of this were Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, and the January 6th shooting of Ashli Babbitt. Both cases are almost always viewed from a partisan perspective on the media and on social media. Major Reddit subreddits, from politics to libertarian, view these cases entirely differently due to politics alone.

From a politically neutral perspective, one was a boy who shot three men in a riot and the other was a federal agent who shot a woman during a riot. I have read very few people who think of the case with the facts alone. Sadly, most are not like this.

In the case of USCP lieutenant Michael Byrd, they (the dominant political and cultural party) call him a hero for shooting Ashli Babbitt. This isn't because they think he was legally justified because then they would have to defend Darren Wilson and Rusten Sheskey. It is solely because he shot some MAGA bitch. The same people dehumanize and vilify his victim.

They often call her a terrorist while defending rioters they agree with, went into her past social media records to find that she made one driving rant years ago and tweeted rudely to VP-elect Kamala Harris, and even compare her to Timothy McVeigh. Whether you find the shooting justified is a separate story. There are disturbing cases in which the more extreme Democrats often berate and abuse others who find the shooting justified because they don't take pleasure in it. Yes, they are this inhuman that they harass their friends for showing droplets of humanity.

With the Kyle Rittenhouse trial coming up, they would be consistent in holding the young man to the same standard they held Michael Byrd. Instead, they treat him like a white supremacist monster who went out of state to murder people. They truly believe this kid was a racist murderer whose mom drove him hours so he could shoot... only three white men.

The case is trending this week because of Kyle Rittenhouse's ""victims."" The media and the public are outraged that Judge Schroeder banned people from referring to people as victims in a self-defense case. ""So what if they were looting, rioting and committing arson"" they demand while praising the shooting of an unarmed trespasser/climber. They have such principles that it doesn't matter to them that the first guy Kyle shot had raped children. It's because all human lives matter, even pedophiles, but never those who defy Kween Kamala.

The first person to describe their beliefs as “libertarian” was Joseph Déjacque in 1857, and the term was then used to describe socialist/anarchist beliefs for around 100 years, until it was co-opted by the American right in the mid 1900s, and it then became associated with free market capitalism.

This is the verifiable history of libertarianism as an ideology, yet so many right libertarians just completely refuse to accept it. There are constant posts on this sub about how socialists shouldn’t be allowed here, or that libertarian-socialism is an oxymoron, yet the libsocs have been using the term to describe their beliefs for 100 years longer than the rightlibs have.

- I can’t stand the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party, I feel there both full of themselves and care only for themselves and not The People
- Don’t like Joe Biden nor Donald Trump, both are not the answer to what America needs
- I can’t stand the biased News networks like CNN and FOX NEWS, it’s not News it’s unwanted opinionated propaganda. Give me REALITY BASED NEWS be it Good or Bad
- I support Masks and Vax for the most part at Work and in School, I don’t piss/shit myself if I’m asked to put a mask on it’s not just for me it’s for my wife and kin. I don’t believe people should be forced to get the vax, yet as someone who both works in the medical field and seen anti-vax family and family friends get COVID-19 that shit fucks you up. You don’t want the vax I support that I do! I believe we should think of others also and keep safe
- To add to the above I greatly support home schooling, I do see Indoctrination being mixed in with Education
- I’m not against having Government just the Big,Nosey,Party oriented,Den of thieves,Crime Syndicate types
- Not a fan of Political Party’s being in power. “A house divided can’t stand” ie They divide the people and use them as pons
- I have a Socratic view on Democracy ie I don’t believe any random person should be able to lead, they should be educated on leadership and the true needs of The People, not there own (Watch Socrates Philosophical view on Democracy) https://youtu.be/fLJBzhcSWTk
- I’m Pro-Gun, I feel I should be lawfully and rightfully allowed to carry a gun for self-protection and most importantly that of my wife and household anywhere and at any time
- I don’t support (for lack of a better word) mega-capitalism ie large corporations, I “mostly” (I try real hard) support the little guys the mom an pops and those like them
- I don’t care much about the Financial Economy, as a prepper I care about self sustainability and I like the idea of barter, be it food, materials or work
- I support a form of Socialized Med, I believe medication is a human right and should be accessible to all and not go into debt

He was pointing out that they were — with clear and corrupt bias — going after critics of Pfizer...and yet all of their shows doing so were *sponsored* by Pfizer. A conflict of interest.

I was thinking about how this is worse than he seems to realize. Pfizer is getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money right now, which it then passes on to CNN to keep it in line...but this isn't a just case of ""them damned corporations owning the politicians"", it's a symptom of the real problem:

Corporate law was set up, originally, to let powerful politicians and their cronies own the economy directly. It's not so much corporations bribing politicians, as the political class setting up the corporations in the first place, therefore owning most of what we need, therefore controlling us.

* Liberal voters hate corporations. And they're right to.
* Conservative voters distrust politicians. And they're right to.

They're both right, because corporations and politicians are the same group.

* Liberals think corporations bribe politicians.
* Conservatives think politicians unjustly control corporations through regulations.

But, in reality, both are an oversimplification, when the real problem is that the political class is comprised both of corporate boards and politicians as a single group, often with the same person being both.

**Remember**, Hillary had to resign from the board of Wal Mart to run on fighting corporations.

**Remember**, at the very same time her campaign was emailing corporate executives, promising she'd be better for corporations than Trump.^(\*)

**Remember**, her campaign was simultaneously planning with the various Media outlets on both how to steal the nomination from Bernie AND how to get Trump nominated, on the theory that he couldn't win the general election.^(\*)

So the problem isn't that CNN is paid by Pfizer, who pays politicians to pay it billions of taxpayer dollars, because it pays millions in lobbying and campaign contributions.

No, that's a symptom, not the problem.

The problem is that ***Pfizer, CNN, and the Federal government are all the same group of corrupt robber barons***, in the first place.

Now before everyone here attacks me and accuses me of being a Republican, I am not, far from it. I can hear the booing already but I voted for Joe Biden (Bernie Sanders was my first choice). Now the covid pandemic really changed my political views. I use to be a democrat, until I saw that both republicans and democrats are corrupt to the core, and they funded trillions of dollars in pork towards so called ""covid relief"".

Anyways, when I really thought about how the world works, libertarian philosophy seemed to be the most efficient method in handling issues in the world. One of the things that didn't set well with me was SNAP/WIC/Food Stamps. Does that mean I hate the poor?, heck no, I use to be poor myself. Do I want the rich to donate more to charity, absolutely!, but unfortunately the rich are greedy bastards.

&amp;#x200B;

When I really thought about food, I realized that 30-40% of the USA's food in the food supply chain is completely wasted (source: [https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs)). It made me think about how perhaps government regulations were part of the problem regarding food waste. I figure that we should allow the food market to be deregulated as long as food has proper labeling (such as GMO labelling, ingredients, additives, etc). Imagine if we legalized dumpster diving. I feel that if you throw something out, it becomes public property. If a grocery store throws away food, it should be up for grabs. I feel that supermarkets should be allowed to donate old food to charity without legal liability if they disclose that it's AS-IS food.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I thought about was NAFTA and immigration, how nice would it be if instead of the USA only buying US based meats, we could legally buy Mexican baloney or tomatoes? I feel that open borders could be another aspect to making food affordable for Americans. It would be nice if farmers could hire migrants from other countries to help us pick our crops, migrants get paid, and food prices drop further.

&amp;#x200B;

The final thing about food stamps was another thing that bothers me about food stamps. We are basically subsidizing junk food for the poor when 22 cents on the dollar of food stamps is used on junk foods like soda/processed chips. I'm okay with people eating junk food, but junk food is a need, not want. In addition people shouldn't be eating garbage food with my tax dollars. I also despise how corporations exploit welfare recipients and have companies like Walmart paying workers absurdly low ($12/hour), then count on them using food stamps to fund their food, then Walmart is profiting off these workers on the backs of the American taxpayers. It would be like if every year, I sent a check to Walmart of $300/year for their ""employee food drive fund"". I don't want my tax dollars helping Walmart get bigger, I want mom n' pop grocery chains get bigger. Please let me vote with my dollars. I also hate the welfare trap. I have sympathy for the poor and I wish that there were better ways to help the poor. Not every problem is solved with throwing money at it.

&amp;#x200B;

If we really want to end poverty, end the welfare trap. This is where a welfare family gets promoted or gets paid more, then they lose their government benefits. One of my co workers at work is eligible for overtime that could double his salary, but instead he works 25 hours a week so he doesn't lose his benefits. I don't blame him, but I believe we could have a more productive society if we got rid of requirements to get food stamps. Either we get rid of food stamps entirely and let the people vote with their dollars for charities. Or if we have public assistance, let's make it economical, and healthier. Taxes should be going towards needs if we dare to have taxes. If someone is legitimately hungry, they'll happily eat a potato, rice, beans, veggies, maybe an egg or chicken. Meals can be made wholesale for 50 cents a meal if not cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel disgusted that the government created a welfare state with all these cons, and we could live in a society that promotes moving up, promotes community, and promotes deregulation of absurd food restrictions. I know a lot of people here don't agree with me, but I hope I changed some views here.",Shitpost,64.04,10.3

That's why I'm here after all. But I'm sort of a casual libertarian in that the general premise appeals to me, but I've never delved deeply into the philosophy of it or into actual policy proposals from libertarians to solve societal issues.

I'm personally very much of the 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' mindset. And I generally believe that where you end up in life is a result of your own choices and not the choices made by your 'representatives' in Congress. Finally, I believe that anyone can succeed if they work hard. But this doesn't mean ignoring the fact that many, or even most or all, people will run into obstacle in their lives preventing the path from being easy. Some of the obstacles will be severe and, on rare occasions, insurmountable. But for the most part, I feel like the human spirit and ingenuity can overcome most things.

I have a good friend who is liberal/leftist and thinks that I basically live in a bubble. She says I don't understand how hard some people have it and that some people just can't get themselves out of poverty. I'm using poverty as an example because... Income inequality has become a huge topic of contention over the past several years. But she may be right that I live in a bubble.

She reminded me tonight about how there are years long waiting lists to get into section 8 housing. Homeless can't get into shelters because they're full. Battered women can't get into shelters for the sake reason. Some people can't work due to mental illness or diminished capacity. Any number of reasons... People can't feed themselves or their families due to low income.

My initial thoughts on people who need to find shelter because they're homeless is to go live with family. But if they don't have family... Where do they go if shelters aren't available? For mentally or physically handicapped people or those with severe mental illness who can't work, my initial response is to say they should be institutionalized. But we couldn't rely on charity to run the facilities. They would fail. But I also would not be for subsidizing these institutions with my tax dollars. So what's to be done?

Where do we draw the line between personal responsibility and needing the government to step in. I don't think we can just let those of us who are down on their luck or who we're dealt a bad hand at birth rot away as the world passes them by. But I also don't think government should provide everything they need at our expense.

What are some other scenarios you can think of where people need help getting back on their feet where society can't (or shouldn't, I should say) just sit idly by but also where government shouldn't be expected to do anything.

It also irks me that we are subsidizing companies like Walmart to pay their employees sub liveable wages by having food stamps as a buffer and incentive for companies like Walmart to pay people less. Welfare is part of the reason companies get away with paying people less money.

If an organized religion were to plan the immolation of 523,335 of the faithful in a decade,' there is no question that it would be toppled. Were there a Manson-type cult that murdered 790 people to celebrate Memorial Day, 770 to usher in the Fourth of July, 915 to commemorate Labor Day, 960 at Thanksgiving, and solemnized Christmas with 355 more deaths, surely The New York Times would wax eloquent about the carnage, calling for the greatest manhunt this nation has ever seen. If Dr. Spock were to learn of a disease that killed 2,077 children under the age of five each year, or were New York City's Andrew Stein to uncover a nursing home that allowed 7,346 elderly people to die annually there would be no stone unturned in their efforts to combat the enemy. To compound the horror, were private enterprise responsible for this butchery, a cataclysmic reaction would ensue: investigation panels would be appointed, the justice department would seek out antitrust violations, company executives would be jailed, and an outraged hue and cry for nationalization would follow.
The reality, however, is that the government is responsible for such slaughter-the toll taken on our nation's roadways. Whether at the local, state, regional, or national level, it is government that builds, runs, manages, administers, repairs, and plans for the roadway network. There is no need for the government to take over; it is already fully in charge, and with a vengeance.

The MS Supreme Court overturned the new law by deciding that the whole initiative process is invalid.

Their logic is that when it was added to the constitution in 1992, it required that an equal number of the necessary petition signatures to get an initiative on the ballot must come from all five of MS's congressional districts. Specifically, it said that no more than 20% of signatures may come from any single district. But in the 2000 census, MS lost a district, and now only has four. So, they reasoned, more than 20% of signatures came from each district, and therefore no ballot initiatives could happen.

So the Court ruled that the power to bypass the legislature that the people had gained no longer exists, and that they must trust in the legislature to fix it for them.

\---

The problems with this logic are endless.

First, there's the fact that their radically textualist ruling ignores the actual text of MS law. The legislature never updated its maps; federal courts had to draw new congressional districts and order they be used for federal elections, after 2000. So if you only looked to the MS constitution and the laws passed by its legislature, you'd never know there weren't five districts.  And since this was the MS supreme court reviewing a challenge to an MS law  which had absolutely nothing to do with the federal government...doing that would make sense. It's not like that'd be an unusual application of the district law, either; it's a geographical shorthand that is used elsewhere. There are five commissioners on the state's community college board, with each seat dedicated to one of the five old districts, for example. But instead the justices reached outside of MS law to find a reason to render a part of the constitution useless.

Second, there's the obvious intent. No one thought ""20%"" was a magic number, they just wanted to ensure that an initiative had support from all parts of the state, rather than just being popular in one city or something. The Court danced around this point by suggesting that it could've been a mistake, or maybe the legislature actually wanted to sabotage the law when they wrote it, as if elected officials being incompetent or dishonest is supposed to be a reason to respect their legitimacy. And in opposition to that premise is the fact that the Attorney General of the state had already said ""yes we use the five district map found in the MS code for this, not the actual federal districts"".

Third, there's basic jurisprudence. The MS Supreme Court derives its authority from the MS constitution. They can rule that statutes and regulations passed by other parts of the government are unconstitutional, but what authority do they have to say that the constitution is functionally overruled? What authority do they have to apply law from outside of their jurisdiction to do so? How did they find that the plaintiff even had standing to challenge the process, when they've said that a lack of an actual, individualized harm can bar people from challenging improperly passed government acts? (For example, the governor had pardoned lots of unpopular people without going through the correct legal process, but the court said that didn't mean that the pardons were retroactively invalidated.) And they had the gall to say that they're creating this chaos and uncertainty (are all of the other initiatives passed in the last twenty years invalid? Who knows!?) was because they weren't supposed to re-write the law, and they just had no choice.

 \---

Of course, the real reason for all of this is that neither the court nor the legislature like the people having a direct influence over the law; that undermines the whole basis of their elite positions. And lots of old Republicans (obviously the court and legislative majority) hate marijuana. They found a legal technicality upon which they could achieve their desired result, rather than looking at the law impartially and determining what the proper result should be.

So now the legislature can say ""it's the court's fault!"" and no individual member will take any heat for not getting the problem fixed, so there'll be no electoral pressure for the legislature to fix it. And the court can continue to say ""it's the legislature's fault!"" because the body that stands to lose its power has the power to do so.

Just like in 1922, when the court overturned its own ruling of five years previous to strike down MS's first supermajority-approved direct democracy amendment, because it authorized both ballot initiatives *and* referenda, and another part of the constitution said amendments should only have one subject. And it took 70 years before the legislature could again be made to act. Politicians understand that political momentum is temporary, and that if they can delay they can destroy.",Politics,52.87,8.4

Libertarian,Was the United States a Tyrannical Country before 2003,"*NOTE: I posted a nearly identical question on r/JoeRogan due to his views on the mandates. I feel this also fits in this forum and I would get enough of a different response to warrant it.*

With all the controversy around vaccine mandates by businesses, state governments and the federal government, there has been a common refrain that this is tyrannical.

Tyranny determined by a violation of their constitutional rights.

If this is the case, my question is: was America before 2003 a tyrannical state?

Here are a list of laws that the Supreme Court determined violated people’s constitutional rights.

Until 2003 at least 14 states had laws stating only sex for procreation was allowed.

Until 1967 there were 17 states with laws determining who you could marry based on physical appearance.

Until 1965 at least 11 states had laws demanding a poll tax, literacy and comprehension tests before voting.

Until 1965 at least 26 states had laws determining whether you could use contraceptives if you were married.

Until 1964 at least 11 states had laws determining where you could eat, sleep, live, work and what schools you could go to based on your physical appearance.

Until 1961 at least 7 states had laws requiring people in public office be Christian.

All these laws were enforced and carried criminal penalties. Some up to 15 years in prison.

*DISCLAIMER: I have not stated my opinion of the matter, and I do not intend to. I created the post because I don’t think it’s a popular concept that America in the past has been tyrannical, and am interested in peoples opinion.

Let's forget the fact private roads, along with lots of ""Libertarian"" ideas, used to be a thing.  But let's focus on current implementation.  Let's say I'm driving to work, the first ""checkpoint"" or ""toll"" asks for $5.  I say ok and hand them the money, in this scenario whatever is used as money could be anything.  Next ""checkpoint"" or ""toll"" asks me for $5 and my driver's license or ""papers"".  I hand them the currency and hand them my papers, and off I go.  Next checkpoint they ask for $5, papers and Vaccine information.  I give them this and go on.  Next check point they ask for the above but now I need an antibody test.  Luckily for me they have a testing center there, except it looks quite dirty and shoddy.

I decide this just isn't worth the risk.  I turn around, pay my tolls again, produce my documents again, and hope there is another way to work.

Around 16% of Americans are on some kind of food stamps program. What never sets well with me and food stamps is that people sell food stamps for drugs. Some people receiving food stamps isn't because they're hungry, but rather they choose a low paying job and both companies/consumers want the government to subsidize their lifestyle.

Don't get it twisted, I hate corporate welfare where governments subsidize and give incentives to businesses. But I feel that food stamps could be done better. Imagine if a warehouse had tons of tomatoes, apples, oranges, bananas, pineapples, anything under the sun. What if people who normally would have a SNAP/EBT card instead had an online website with their credentials. They then get a food basket from this government food warehouse of fruits, veggies, legumes, chicken, eggs, whole grain bread, nuts if they don't have an allergy, etc. For religious or dietary restrictions, a recipient would receive accomodations of similar monetary value.

I don't think the poor should be buying Doritos, pastries, and other junk food on my tax dimes.  If they want to buy it with their money, fine, but food should be healthy if it's for the poor on the backs of taxpayers.

I feel that there's a lot of government waste with food stamps being used at gas stations and grocery stores. We would be better off having the government buy it wholesale, then give families ""bread baskets"" every week of real food.

In a pure libertarian society, food stamps wouldn't even be a thing. The poor would need to work or get donations from private organizations. A good compromise would be cut the costs of food stamps and give the poor actual real food bought wholesale.

This burden does not scale with income, and is likely mostly flat per citizen (with some small exceptions).

State taxes that cover roads and education should be use-based (e.g. gas tax, sales tax).

Why should the rich have to pay more? They can, but when people say they should lay their “fair share”, it’s actually not fair at all.

Flat tax (%) is closer than our progressive system, but still the rich pay more than their burden.  Fair tax is reasonable, but still is inconsistent with respect to the base burden.

A flat ($) tax, say $5000 per year, is effectively the membership cost to be in the country, and feels fairest for the federal level.  At the state level, which has more use-based burdens, Fair tax may be better…but a discussion for another day.

Unfortunately however, these two are the parties that get the most attention and therefore the most votes.

So I came up with a new way of doing taxes. I'm sure Biden will be calling any day now for my help to implement it. All jokes aside, I think this is more fair:

Basically we take the yearly expenditures and divide it by the total number of adults in the US. Then Jan 1st you get a bill with that number. No one paying an unfair share, no loop holes. At the bottom of the bill is an opt-out sheet. If you don't want to pay for something you check the box, but it also means you cant use the service. Obviously no one can opt out of military or a few specific things but otherwise you pay for what you use. Don't own a kid, deduct education tax. Don't use welfare? Deduction. Don't use public transit? Deduction.

This is great in alot of ways. It will show people what percentage of their money goes to what area. It makes sure everyone is paying the same amount.

Instead, the system of taxes should be everyone gets to vote on categories of tax funding, and everyone gets to vote for, neutral, or against tax increases in some increment. For instance if the vote is to pay for police but with 10% less funding, then the police departments get 10% less funding.

Those who opt out of paying taxes in some categories, they also lose the benefits of that service for the year. If I vote for no police funding, I don't pay police taxes. But in return, I also do not get any police protection at all.

For those who are poor, elections with taxpayers could decide to pay taxes for those who can't pay taxes to allow for free riders, only if society sees it as necessary. For example, the taxpayers voted for free services for anyone not paying taxes with an income below $12,000 a year.

The tax fees would be the price of the service, divided by every tax payer who voted for that service. For instance a town bridge is 1 million dollars, the town taxpayers of 2000 votes for it pay for the bridge at $500 a taxpayer. Those who voted against it AND don't pay the bridge tax, don't get to use the bridge. Seems simple to me. If the town wants an emergency use exemption, then maybe a non taxpayer must pay a $100 toll to cross it.

To me this seems logical.

The only taxes that might need to be mandatory is for a bare bones state military where people vote for the funding, and environmental/fire protections, that's it.

If you itemize, you can deduct state and local taxes from your federal taxable income. This allows you to avoid being taxed federally on taxes you pay to the state or local municipality. If you take standard deduction, same concept. FICA taxes do not deduct from your federal taxable income. FICA taxes are calculated from gross income but paid for from your net pay after federal income taxes are taken out. The feds get away with this by considering them FICA contributions, but forcing us to have money taken from our paychecks feels a lot more like a tax.

Ex: You make $10,000 a month. Your effective federal tax rate is 20% (for simplicity). FICA taxes will be $765/month. Since these taxes are not deducted from your taxable income you pay 20% federal tax on your $765 ""contribution"" ($153). This $153 isn't taken out of the ""contribution"" but out of your take home pay. This means yearly you are being taxed $1,836 for forced contributions to sub-par government retirement plans.

I feel that a common libertarian ideal is ending the drug prohibition, then why should we have a restriction on food as well? I cannot imagine someone having food that's so dangerous, and still remain in business if it's as lethal as meth.

I could envision a bad company putting in sawdust, not caring about insects, and other annoying nuisances. Yet I feel that the market would correct itself and simply not buy faulty products. We see this a lot with consumer goods. Right now, you could order a Chinese knockoff laptop for $50 on AliExpress. Now why aren't you doing that? It's because the laptop would be made out of McDonald's toy plastic, a Dorito computer chip, 256 MB of ram, a 2 GB SD card, and a screen with etch a sketch on the side.

Do we need the US laptop patrol arbitrarily checking laptops that meet a government set of standards?, or can we be grown ass adults and decide for ourselves what we want to buy? I feel that we don't truly live in a free society until we let adults decide what they wish to put in their bodies.

If I want to buy cookies from a homemade Baker, let me do that. If I want to buy a kids lemonade who could've not cleaned the jug, I'll take my chances if I wish. If Nestle wants to release roadkill canned meat, I just won't buy it. We could have private inspection companies check for food quality. We could use word of mouth, cancel culture, and brand reputation to get proper goods safe to eat.

In a deregulated food market, we would likely see 30% cut in food costs. It would really help out the poor and allow for market competition to take hold with food sales.

The only food regulation I support are 2 things, 1 is all ingredients and contents must be labeled on all items sold. The other condition is someone can send in an auditor at any time to inspect the facility. Other than that, legalize sawdust Wendy's chili, horsemeat hot dogs, and yoga mattress subs from subway.

Biden killed the pipeline. They are also not leasing out federal land to drill oil. That why Biden can claim that the US is using less oil.

All while asking Russia and Opec to sell us more oil. And giving them the go ahead to contiue using the Russian pipe line.

China is building more coal plants and are the biggest populators.

The US has a lot of clean energy but thats not good enough for the democrats. This will cause energy prices to go up. This is their intention

They want to force Americans out of fossil fuels. No doubt its going to be a cold winter this year for a lot of poor Americans.

Public schools and teachers are also very liberal. We know how they are trying to teach libtard subjects and have gender neutral sports and bathrooms.

Corporate America are also super liberal. Their PR and CEOs try to outdo each other with their wokeness.

Almost all US cities are ran by liberals. You can tell this because they didn't stop the BLM and Antifa rioters. They refuse to address high crime and are very anti small business. They dont care about petty theft and about the homeless problem.

Government Federal institutions like the FBI, CIA and other ABC organization are also super liberal. The ACLU said they won't be helping out rightwingers.

Pro Sports and the Liberal media are also super liberal.

Big Tech is also super liberal.

The globalist like the UN and Nato are also a bunch of liberals. So is most of Europe. Not but liberals there.

What do conservatives dominate? Small country communities in the middle of no where? Mega Churches. Blue color jobs IE people who work for their money perhaps.  Trucking industry IE people who actually work for their money. MMA fighting, honkey cause they are not so mainstream.

So I'd submit that nothing is every truly absolute. And that in a masculine republic, there should be a tiny little bit of authoritarianism. And it's this: You don't talk about the redistribution of wealth. You can talk about how bad Taxation and socialism was, for the sake of discussing history. But never in the ""Hey let's do that"" sense. If a politician suggests it, they're thrown out of office immediately and it's off to 5 years in prison. No exceptions. Obviously drafting a bill and trying to get it passed falls under that.

If a citizen speaks in public promoting it, he/she does 5 years in prison no possibility of parole. Suggesting that these kinds of laws (or their punishments) be changed, in any way, carries the exact same penalty as committing the crime. Because you're trying to circumvent the law in order to be able to commit the crime. And these are just the first round of punishments. If you keep it up, it will lead to exile or some manner of permanent deportation. And if someone doesn't like this, well they're free to leave! We would never tell someone that they must live here. It's not our way. We're real big on freedom, such that we'll actively fight to defend it from tyrants. By throwing them in prison.

It's basically the system we have now just in reverse. Now, the tyrants grab power, and they throw innocent people in prison. This would simply turn that around, and the innocent people would throw the tyrants in prison. It's gonna be one or the other, and I find throwing the guilty in jail far more palatable than the innocent.

How would this be a bad thing? Set up the republic for permanent unchangeable freedom. The laws aren't subject to change. *No really, you're not changing them.* Ever. Try and you'll pay dearly. And thus, people just go on not being taxed. Not paying for the welfare of others. Looking to their own needs. Just as they did pre 1911.

I really thought about this, and the late 1800s book ""The Jungle"". You betcha that in a libertarian society, there would be some ultra shady vendors selling bottom tier meats, foods, and filthy foods.

But then I realized the beauty of the free market, if you don't like the food, then don't buy it! Nobody is putting a gun up to your head to eat nasty food. Just like how in today's controlled food marketplace, nobody is forcing you to eat expired food or shop at places you don't like.

The only food regulation I support is One thing. That is to have the business disclose ingredients and contents in the food on the food label. For instance, Campbell's soup contains chicken, vegetable oil, wheat flour, with steel/BPA, etc. This disclosure of ingredients would be self regulated. In the event of probable cause, a plantiff could have a judge sign a warrant to check for things not disclosed being put in the product.

And people wonder why food prices go up. When you require food licenses, you're stopping the little guy from competing with your large food companies. In a deregulated food market, food would go from the finest caviar, all the way down to uncle Riley's mystery spam meat for 1 dollar a pound. Companies could pay for private certifications for quality of their meat, similar to how the motion picture association of America rates movies. Also if food companies got too big, people could start growing their own food and compete with the big guys driving down prices, along with raising quality.

Granted, no system is perfect, but please stop the government messing with my food!

Also, in Article III Section 3, it states:

One side gets heated about taking a life. One side gets heated about taking an individual's rights. These are two entirely different arguments, no shit we can't find common ground.

Let's be real, virtually no one (I think) is pro ""killing babies"". Even late term abortion, almost by definition, means that the carrier was expecting to carry to full term, and there is now a health concern to the mother or baby.

Let's also be real, virtually no one (I think) is sitting around rubbing their hands together thinking ""how do we control women's bodies"".

My off the cuff thought is that if the fetus is truly alive, it should be able to survive outside of the womb without directly relying on the mother (this may not be the best wording, but I hope the concept is clear). If the fetus can be removed, hooked up to what ever advanced tech available and live, from a pro life perspective, isn't that a better solution than the one we have now? And if it can't survive without relying on another and despite our best medical efforts, *is it really alive?*

Sure, this raises other concerns like who will pay for it, etc, and I'm interested in what issues and solutions people think would arise from this, but with how polarizing this issue is, aren't better solutions worth pursuing? Hell, have a ""competition"" to see who can produce the most of these artificial wombs the cheapest. Is it possible we find common ground with a solution more like this?

To understand this you must understand why we have central banks and where the fiat money system comes from: Once upon a time there was free exchange of goods and services. Money was just a tradeable good like anything else, just a way of carrying a lot of value in the smallest space possible. Different kingdoms, banks or businesess would make their own money, based on silver, gold, copper, spices or whatever, and people were free to use any of those to store their wealth and to accept any form of money as payment. This was not favourable to governments, since when they wanted to spend more they would mint worse quality coins with less gold or silver in them, so the people, being free to choose, would prefer to use higher quality coins minted by other kingdoms or by private entities. In order to prevent this governments had an amazing idea: ""let's monopolize money and it's supply"", so any kind of money not created by the state became forbidden. This is how central banks were created, and how fiat money came to existance. Fiat means ""to rule by decree"", a kind of money whose value is based purely on the power of the rulers to force people to it. And so the idea of money changed, it stopped being a simple good powered by it's practicality of use to one whose value comes from the power of tyranny. This made rulers able to finance their war interests just by creating more money (thus stealing from the people through inflation) and to control the interest rate (previously set by the free market) so they could profit from lower interests when they were in debt and from higher interests when they were lending. One of the first in history to do this was Kublai Khan, mongol emperor, who succesfully used this fiat money system to fund the invasion of China at the expense of his subjects. Now I have a question for you: Do you really think allowing your ruler to define what forms of money are acceptable and to increase the supply of that money based on their interests is something good for you? I don't think so.",Economics,-320.66,158.1

Recently scrolling through the internet to find certain US states and cities now make you be 21 to be employed as a stripper and Texas goes as far as to ban 18 to 20 year olds from working in 'sex orientated businesses' including sex shops and places that sell erotic fiction. All under the guise of 'child protection'. Good way to restrict the freedom of legal adults while taking away valuable resources that could be used to save actual children from sex trafficking ironically.

&amp;#x200B;

Brings me to more dumb age restrictions in America. 21 to smoke tobacco and weed and drink alcohol and buy certain guns and now be a stripper in some places but can be found guilty as an adult for possessing or doing these things. Trialing kids as adults from the day they are born in some states yet sending people to die in pointless wars at 18. I understand that older children can know what is right and wrong on a basic level but the issue is that they can not understand the more complicated situations nor predict consequences in the same way a legal adult can.

&amp;#x200B;

Just have full rights and responsibility at 18 (although I don't object to people gaining certain rights prior to 18 like voting at 16, purchasing drinks with low levels of alcohol at 16, driving at 14 and sex at 15 with 2 year buffer if at least one is under 15) or at least raise the age of criminal responsibility (the age you can be trialed as an adult) and the age to join the military to 21. Regardless, full rights should occur at the same age as full responsibility.",Discussion,-206.98,114.4
Libertarian,A BottomUp instead of currently prevalent TopDown structures in PoliticsDemocraciesConstitutions,"Two recurring problems in currently prevalent democracies in the world are:

* The politics/power is not accessible to the average person. By which I mean that for most people it's not really a practical or realistic goal. Only certain kind of people go into and succeed in Politics(you know which kind), AND you need lots of money to be able to win elections.

* The choices of candidates is constrained heavily by the Top-Down Political Party structure. There are too few relevant parties, to begin with(most democracies are effectively two-party systems for the most part). And those parties candidates are constrained by the party ideology and direction, which is set by few men at the top of party leadership. This severely constrains the diversity of political thought and proposals, which could have been otherwise possible.

A Bottom-Up approach:

The idea is to create groups of 5-10 people, with each group voting and selecting their representatives for the next level. Then at next level, the same process repeats(ie groups of 5-10 are formed and voting happens), and this process repeats until you get the numbers for Senate/Congress. So, with a population of 1 million and a group of 10, for example, 100,000 groups of 10 will be formed at the first level; then at the next level 10,000 groups of 10 will be formed, and so on..

The groups need not remain the same every election and can be randomly constituted each time. To eliminate fraud, coercion, bribes and corruption, anonymous voting is to be implemented at all levels of the process, including at the Senate/Congress.

Coupled with this, is to have a Presidential System, where any number of candidates can stand in election, and after the results are announced, any candidate can, support or transfer his/her vote to, another candidate. They can also however withdraw their votes or support, anytime before the next elections. The candidate with the highest number of votes, at any given time is deemed President.(So Presidents can change multiple times, before the next due election, without any need for conducting elections. Which also means that elections can be held at fixed intervals regardless of results)

This kind of Presidential System would allow for much diversity of choice during elections. Because multiple people from the same party can stand for elections, and that there is no condition that a candidate has to get a majority of votes, people wouldn't merely not vote for their preferred candidate just because they think that he/she has no chance of winning. They would know that even if their preferred candidate doesn't stand a chance to become a President him/herself, there is a considerable chance of him/her playing a crucial supporting role in someone else's Presidency and thereby having a say. So, people's preferences would be better captured in the Political System.

I think that the Bottom-Up approach to select Senate/Congress, is far better than the current democratic systems. Few salient points why I think so:

* No corruption with regards to Party fund donations.

* Eliminates the need for all the expenditure/spending done in election times.
Eliminates the significance and thus destroys the phenomenon of fake news in Election context.

* Will provide much higher voter turnouts, as you will be voting in a group of just 5-10 people, so will be much more motivated to vote, as the impact of your vote is much more obvious, explicit and visible to you, AND most importantly, you stand a chance(like everyone) for getting selected for the next level, and ultimately for the Senate/Congress seat.

* As a result of so many iterations(a population of 10 million will have around 5 levels of voting), it will definitely increase the quality of people ultimately selected for Legislature many folds!

* One counterargument is that with no 'career' possible in Politics and people getting elected probably for just one time, they will perform poorly. My response to that would be to take a look at every second term of a US President.

* Will be much more democratic in selecting the Legislature, as now one wouldn't require a grand scale funding and advertising, and a compromise in his/her moral principles, in order to get selected. In short, any decent and deserving person among us, can be selected.

* In the current system, people have little option as Political Startups are just not that easy. To much extent, I think this problem will be rectified.

* There will be no Party High Command culture and thus this new system is highly democratizing and decentralizing.

Problems/Criticism of this approach:

* This will be immensely expensive and nightmarish to execute -

 I agree. Two things can help. One, is to exploit the administrative/political structure to reduce redundancy. So, we can have this approach to select County/City/District level Senate/Congress. At the end of it's term, these Senates/Congresses selects, amongst themselves, the members for State level Senate/Congress, and that in turn, selects the members for national level Senate/Congress. And this cycle/chain continues indefinitely..

 Second, is to replace the bottom and top most level of this process by lottery. Why lottery? Because we will be hitting two targets with just this one thing. We just want 'good enough' members for the Senate/Congress; there is no point in obsessing with 'the best'. More important is to keep them from arrogance and corruption. Lottery will induce humility in them and reduce the feelings of 'pride' and 'arrogance' which potentially lead to corruption of mind.(You can also watch this TED talk for a more detailed explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm75Fz6D5nA)

 It's also important to note here that it might be possible to execute this whole process online. You just need a Reddit kind of forum where groups can discuss issues and then vote for their preferred choice. If this can be done, it will reduce the cost of execution immensely.

* In a society greatly polarized along certain lines/issues, each level of elections/voting exaggerates the power of the group with a slight numerical advantage, and having multiple levels keeps exaggerating that even more. -

 Yup that's a problem, agreed. One thing we can do is to have reservations based on any criteria deemed important and on which basis, considerable discrimination exist in society. So, it could be race, caste, class, gender, religion, etc.

 Second thing we can do is to make it mandatory for the President's consent, for every law/bill passed by the Senate/Congress. Because President is being elected directly and NOT by the Bottom-Up process, the aforementioned effect will be neutralized.

Two common ways are to measure to supply of money, and another is to measure prices for things.

Over the last few decades, the supply of money has gone up tremendously,  but consumer prices themselves have not.

As I have discovered,  this is not necessarily a contradiction. The federal reserve relies on the prices of goods and services to measure inflation, but ignores the price of assets like bonds, stocks, real estate,  etc. When the fed lowers interest rates, and performs quantitative easing, asset prices are the things primarily affected, not goods and services.

It's interesting that the inflation of assets is considered good, but the inflation of goods and services is considered bad.

On the other hand, Government spending goes right into wages, which increases the demand of goods and services, which hits that measure of inflation.

To simplify things, it seems that the fed just stimulates the rich, while the government stimulates the working class.

It also seems like the only real way that fed quantitative easing can trickle down into the working class economy is via home equity gains from homeowners.  Making housing more expensive doesn't sound to me like good policy.

Libertarian,Equity vs Equality  The Equity Fallacy,"I recently did a video about the concept of equality of outcome and opportunity, or the argument that unequal outcomes imply systemic discrimination. This is a basic rundown on why I believe it's both logically flawed and goes against the principles of a free society. I believe it's time to actually post it on a board that may find it more controversial.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBrRFS1R2J8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBrRFS1R2J8)

Here is a Basic summary for those who don't care to watch the whole thing:

\-The claim ""disparate outcomes between groups is solid evidence of systemic discrimination of the less fortunate group. That if outcomes are not equal then opportunity must not have been equal."" is inherently flawed for logical, ethical, and economical reasons. I make the case that this argument is bad enough that it warrants being called its own fallacy - ""The Equity Fallacy""

\-Logical reasons:

\*It's a False Dichotomy. There are other explanations for disparate outcomes, such as demographics and culture, that are not discrimination.

\*It's shifting the burden of proof by use of outcome bias. Using an outcome to accuse someone of wrongdoing without proof or demonstration is not how evidence works.

\*many of the reasons why inequity does not imply discrimination between groups are largely the same reasons why inequity doesn't imply discrimination between individuals.

\*""God of the gaps"" - Often people will conduct a study on inequity and fail to control for any variables, and then make the assertion that unknown variables that were not tested must be discrimination. This is wrong because gaps in knowledge are supposed to be treated as neutral.

Update 2: it seems most people’s decisions here, if applied by a large percentage of people, would not result in the removal of any laws or regulations.

Also curious if you would pay a company to conduct research on the ethics and practices of companies so you didn’t have to.",Economics,-107.51,76.2

puts their chewed bubblegum on the bottom of their public  desk in their public classroom or a person who pisses all over the wall  and the seat in a public restroom nobody not even the champions of the  public military give a fuck about public property So why bother,"I'm a veteran, recently separated and served for 6\~ years.

Let me share some examples of why public systems are inevitably failures;

**The shop van**.
Ever  unit/shop in our battalion had a van with gov plates assigned to it and  used for moving equipment or running errands. This van was driven  daily. This van was neglected daily. Like 5x missed oil changes,  cigarettes stains, ignored engine lights. These vans were shared and  driven by 12-15 people. One was retired before it hit 30k miles at my  first duty location and it was daily driven in a 5 mile radius.

In contrast every single one of the guys drove *immaculate*  private vehicles. Mustangs, Range Rovers, an old Jag, Lexus, Mercedes,  lots of Jeeps. Updated oil changes, after market parts, weekly car  washes...see where I'm going here?

There  isn't necessarily the case for combat vehicles like tanks, planes,  helis but this is because there are dozens of personnel assigned to  individual maintenance for those vehicles and some liability involved  since there is life and death at play.

**My stuff syndrome.**
When  someone serves in the military they are a public servant, paid by the  tax-payer and serving the public need. With that public responsibility  comes public property; i.e. nothing you use is actually yours.

""Hey don't sit at *my* desk!""
""Who touched *my* phone!?""
""Hey, don't mess with *my* operations plan!""
Even so far as to say,
""Private Snuffy is *my* trooper!""

The  reality is, even for the highest ranking officer or NCO, nothing is  actually theirs. Not even the publicly funded uniform on their back.  It's all pretend and only operates at a level of juvenile  extortion/coercion. It is my belief that the Human mind cannot actually *operate properly* in this type of public domain and needs to create a subconscious *facade of personal property*, which creates quite the dilemma for practical matters and sane mutual cooperation. Hence, the UCMJ.

**Fake Promotions**.
One  of the absolute worst things in the military, for me personally at  least, is the promotion system. All works stops and everything grinds to  a halt in-garrison when even a E-1 is getting promoted. But wait...it's  great when you celebrate someones achievement right? Morale and stuff? *Everyone* gets promoted to E-2, E-3, E04 ect. after enough time is given and enough dues are paid. Like a *union*. There is absolutely *zero*  merit to be celebrated, often times there is simply nothing else better  to do. It's coercive entertainment, like a mandatory circus  performance.

The promotion reports  that have to be written (which don't even matter since the promotion is  guaranteed anyways) are even more hilarious. These are reports that are  so audacious, so over the top and so fluffy they would make the most  notorious resume grafter blush.Example: ' *Conducted SNCO promotion briefing/6 NCOs; clarified process/debunked myths--spurred professional growth* .'

Lol.

**The laptop dilemma**.
This is a true story.

My unit had many to spare and asked what we needed. The unanimous answer was ""new chairs"".

We  got a hundred 'G-shock' field laptops instead. These things were  basically running pentium-2 processors and 1990s blackberry screen  resolutions. But they were ""battlefield durable""...for in-garrison work.  We already had a dozen badass laptops for field work.

We  went back to leadership and said ""You can have these back, we only  needed chairs."" Leadership refused to take them back. We were so pissed  off we made a case of *waste and abuse*  (not as serious as it sounds) of resource allocation. Leadership's  reply was ""Listen, if you return those they will prob get put on a shelf  until end of service life. The money has been spent and we needed to  spend it.""

The total cost was approx 215k\~. They are stored and haven't been powered on to this day.

**Costly benefits**.
I  was briefly stationed at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Oahu. The  primary medical facility there was a big, pink hospital on a hill off of  base, colloquially known as 'Crippler' (actually called Trippler).  Basically everyone on that island has TRICARE coverage and, if they  don't and are local, have to be seen at that facility anyways because of  island law. I witnessed 6-8 hour waits for a basic visit for a  fever/nausea, botched joint surgeries, botched baby deliveries (lots of  those), commonplace multi-month waits for advance procedures that  probably should be done on the same day lol. I mean it's a real  disaster.

BAH (basic allowance for  housing) is another major military benefit. The effect of this benefit  has on the local housing market in the immediate area around a military  base is absolutely astonishing. Let's say the median renter around the  base is a 25 year old E-3 that has a monthly allotment of $2000 a month  for rent. This is public information. Every landlord in the area will  charge $1800 for rent, as much as they realistically can and still get  customers, and there is *no chance* it will ever fall below that threshold. And they know it is *guaranteed income*. Government price fixing at it's finest.

Oh,  and the G.I. Bill. This is actually a great benefit until you realize  that often times military experience, training and clearances *far outweigh*  any higher education or degree in the private sector. So most times the  G.I. Bill is just used by lazy degenerates who separate from the  military early and don't know what to do with their lives because, well,  you can live off it. The G.I. bill will cover up to 100k\~ of your  tuition plus pay for all of your books and and a $2500 monthly stipend  for rent and food. Add FAFSA and Pell Grant to this and you can skate  for 4 years while earning a bullshit degree and *make profit*.

Don't  even get me started on VA disability benefits....but I will share one  example. Sleep apnea. I swear every single person in the military has  some form of sleep apnea. The average soldier is completely hooked on  NAC (nicotine, alcohol, caffeine) and barely sleeps from mind-numbingly  absurd ops temp anyways. A soldier can literally smoke half a pack of  cowboy killers, down half a can of Rip-It and go in for the overnight  test. Any reasonable suspicion is linked to in-service causes = instant  30% disability.

**Actual warfare**.
I'm  thoroughly convinced, after directly experiencing the fake camaraderie,  two-faced attitudes and fake-it-until-you-make-it leadership in the  armed forces, that the public standing military is only as effective as  the *grotesque* amount of money  and largely wasted resources behind it. Nobody serving actually gives a  fuck (with the exception of some true warriors in Spec Ops of course)  about fighting, winning or effectiveness. It's simply about doing just  enough to please the guy above you and avoid any and all unnecessary  responsibility.

Public military forces don't *want*  to fight; they are paid to fight. And not in like a ""mercenary"" way,  no, like in a levied peasant type of way. This is why, in my belief,  private defense and private contracting will always be superior in  quality to the public option.

**Special needs labor**.
In  the military (and many other Federal facilities) the administrative  services hire special needs and mildly disabled individuals to do menial  tasks and labor; i.e. kitchen and janitorial services. I found this  quite disturbing, especially when I witnessed more than a few boogers  being wiped in my mystery-meat burritos at the cafeteria.

Some  might say this is doing those people a favor and the Federal government  are the only ones who would hire them, but here I am saying it is *degrading*. It could just be me and my cynical, jaded ass I suppose. But this isn't my point.

The  base, the publicly funded collection of institutions, is almost  entirely maintained by private entities, to include special needs menial  labor. Why? Because not even the military members who live and work on  them *give a shit*.

Like  the kid who puts their chewed bubblegum on the bottom of their public  desk in their public classroom or a person who pisses all over the wall  and the seat in a public restroom; nobody, not even the champions of the  public (military), give a fuck about public property. *So why bother*?",Philosophy,-1304.87,532.1

Libertarian,What does everyone think of geolibertarianism Georgism is an ideology which states that land value can and should be taxed because theres a fixed amount of land Geolibertarianism is a minarchist brand of libertarianism which suggests that the main role of government is to tax land rent Geolibertarians believe in taxing land rent and turning the revenue into a basic income because land belongs to everyoneHere are some points of consideration for why georgism may be the best form of libertarianism1 Property rights are derived from ownership of ones time and labor Since nobody made land it would not fall under property rights2 An argument can be made that taxation is theft because if left unpaid force will follow However as discussed in point 1 land is not applicable to property rights thus making the LVT an ethical tax3 Just about every form of taxation has some deadweight loss This means that money paid in taxes isnt used for other stuff This would not happen with the LVT because taxing land does not reduce the amount of land available And unlike a property tax it does not punish landowners for upgrading their property4 An LVT would discourage land speculation and byzantine zoning If San Francisco were subject to this kind of tax the same people who push against new development would beg the city government to loosen restrictions so that they can sell their land to developers5 An LVT implemented at state or federal level would make local governments consider the efficient use of land rather than just having roads everywhere In other words single use zoning will be called into question6 An LVT is a progressive tax because land ownership is correlated with wealth It cannot be passed down to renters because the market rate of rent represents the maximum that people are willing to pay7 The LVT is less subject to tax avoidance because you cant move land and there would be no tax evasion as it would be like not paying your rentThis does not necessarily apply in jurisdictions with rent control,"Georgism is an ideology which states that land value can and should be taxed because there's a fixed amount of land. Geolibertarianism is a minarchist brand of libertarianism which suggests that the main role of government is to tax land rent. Geolibertarians believe in taxing land rent and turning the revenue into a basic income because land belongs to everyone.

Here are some points of consideration for why georgism may be the best form of libertarianism:

1. Property rights are derived from ownership of one's time and labor. Since nobody made land, it would not fall under property rights.
2. An argument can be made that taxation is theft because if left unpaid, force will follow. However, as discussed in point 1, land is not applicable to property rights, thus making the LVT an ethical tax.
3. Just about every form of taxation has some deadweight loss. This means that money paid in taxes isn't used for other stuff. This would not happen with the LVT because taxing land does not reduce the amount of land available. And unlike a property tax, it does not punish landowners for upgrading their property.
4. An LVT would discourage land speculation and byzantine zoning. If San Francisco were subject to this kind of tax, the same people who push against new development would beg the city government to loosen restrictions so that they can sell their land to developers.
5. An LVT implemented at state or federal level would make local governments consider the efficient use of land rather than just having roads everywhere. In other words, single use zoning will be called into question.
6. An LVT is a progressive tax because land ownership is correlated with wealth. It cannot be passed down to renters because the market rate of rent represents the maximum that people are willing to pay.\*
7. The LVT is less subject to tax avoidance because you can't move land and there would be no tax evasion as it would be like not paying your rent.

Libertarian,Yesterday I asked a question about English aristocracy owning 13 of land Some people thought I am calling for equality over freedom thats not true I consider myself libertarian but the english aristocracy made their wealth through exploitation in a society where liberty didnt exist,"So wouldn't libertarianism work even better in a society where we atleast confiscate the wealth of people who made it through violating the free will of others. I think that's peak libertarianism. I am not against billionaires who have made their wealth through just means like leftists. I am for free will of the individual until it interferes with someone else. I think even libertarians will agree wealth made through exploitation and violating the free will of others isn't liberty. Its illegal.

However, my views also contrast in several areas:

Military — It isn’t our job to police the world just because we have the strongest fighting force. Our defense budget should be primarily allocated towards defending our own borders while maintaining a neutral foreign policy.

Abortion — I believe it is a sensitive issue that is best handled between a woman and her doctor. The only compromise I am open to is the federal government setting a deadline of 20 weeks for unrestricted eligibility. Afterward, it should be decided on a case-by-case basis in court.

LGBTQ+ rights — Government should make no distinctions on sexual orientation or gender identity regarding marriage, adoption, military service, employment, or any other societal institutions. The deprivation of equal treatment under the law creates a sect of second-class citizens.

Victimless crimes — Consenting adults should be legally allowed to engage in whatever behavior they choose, as long as those decisions neither harm nor threaten the safety of others. The unintended consequences of attempting to regulate lifestyles considered irresponsible, if not immoral, create victims of a nanny state.

Capital punishment — Even though I believe there are irredeemable crimes that warrant the death penalty, I am torn on it from a political perspective, as there is a long history of governments who abuse the practice. It also becomes a concern for those wrongly accused despite improvements in forensic technology. All systems are prone to error.

Religion — Government should neither favor nor discourage any particular religion. The role of the government should be modeled after the non-aggression principle (NAP) instead of Judeo-Christian values. Our Founding Fathers intended for the separation of church and state, as they knew such influence sets a precedent for corruption.

Criminal justice — We should focus more on reform than punishment in principle. With the exception of those convicted of a serious crime that is violent or sexual in nature, ex-convicts should have their Constitutional rights fully restored and their criminal record erased upon paying their debts to society. They should automatically be given the benefit of the doubt with a second chance, unless if the individual is a repeat offender, which would be contingent on a “three-strikes” law.

Euthanasia — A terminally ill patient whose death is imminent should be provided the medical option to have their life ended prematurely to escape an agonizing death. It is cruel to force patients to endure every second of pain ‘til their last breath against their own wishes.

Selective Service — I have no problem with opening all military roles to women, but they should also have to register with the Selective Service. Unless if we abolish the draft altogether, there is no rational argument against implementing such a requirement now. The current policy creates a double standard for men.

Libertarian,Why I believe collective land ownership is libertarian,"How could I dare to make such a bold claim? Well to begin with no one definitively owns the earth. No man created the earth and therefore the earth shouldn't even have an owner. At least things like homes, gadgets, and cars have definitively been made from the Earth's materials and have someone who made items that were sold.

Basically 100% of the land out there has always been here and no man made the land. That is why I believe the land belongs to the collective of people. Nobody should own the land, but rather the society within that land should vote on how land rights are granted.

When someone was a land owner, that person someone down the line bought land off of someone who was forced off that land. A third of the land in England was owned by lords who mistreated serfs and stole land that didn't belong to anyone with the threat of force. The Native Americans were forced off the land by white settlers who stole land that belonged to them. Africans were forced off their land as slaves. The aborigines were forced off the land by Australians. The Asians had their wars and oppressed and pillaged rival Asians.

No populated land exists today that hasn't been stolen or oppressed by somebody. Some say, ""Well life's not fair, get use to it."" But to me that doesn't fly. If my great grandparents has an air loom of gold and someone stole the gold, I and most people in society would call that person a thief. If someone accepts stolen property, even if they didn't know it was stolen, current legal consensus is that the items must be returned back to the rightful owner.

To top it off,  if someone sold the stolen property to someone else who sells it down a line of owners, that person would be called a fencer under the law. A fence is someone who receives stolen property then resells it to someone else. Now to top it off, say we found the stolen air loom and then 50 men with machine guns threaten to kill you if you take back the air loom.

That would be considered a mob. Why is this story any different just because we're dealing with land? So what if the person owning the land didn't consider the rightful owner. So what if the government (the mob) threatens lethal force if you try taking back the land. So what if there's a chain of ownership for stolen property. None of these things are ethical.

You can brush it up to life's not fair and I agree with you. But just because life's not fair doesn't mean we can't try to mitigate damages done. I'm not asking for society to take 100% of the land in the USA and give it to the Native Americans. What I'm asking for is for society to be civilized and arbitrate/mediate the damages done.

I feel that collective land ownership is the most reasonable way to address land usage. My opinion is based on the scientific fact that virtually 100% of Earth's land was NOT man made so no one can claim to be a maker, a significant difference from physical property. The other historical fact is that all inhabited land today was stolen or oppressed against other people. If land wasn't made by man and it was stolen by the original inhabitants, that's fair to say it's an infringement on liberty to not give the public any claims to the land.

Collective land ownership would work like this. All present land owners keep their land and use their land how they wish that doesn't violate other people's rights (like mineral rights, undemocratic pollution, etc). The public would have easement rights to use the land as a way to move on the land for quiet (less than 60db) recreation/hiking/moving. If land is abandoned or someone has an idea to optimize land use, here's what would happen.

Someone could petition to have a city election for what to do with the land, if someone wins the majority vote to develop the land, that person would then have development rights for the specific purpose specified. Say there's abandoned farmland and they want to farm the land, with a town election and winning the vote, they could farm the land. Now if someone mistreats the land and people dislike what they did, their right to develop the land would be revoked. Elections would be held annually.

Collective land ownership seems to be the most democratic method for how land can be used.",Philosophy,21.06,12.3
Libertarian,What a fucking copout Rage Against the Machine supporting Sendero LuminosoShining Path who have much Indigenous blood on their hands,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining\_Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path)

&gt;The Shining Path has been widely condemned for its brutality,\[3\]\[4\] including violence deployed against peasants, trade union organizers, competing Marxist groups, elected officials and the general public.\[5\]

&amp;#x200B;

[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Shining\_Path](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Shining_Path)

&gt;Those working for the government were not the only targets — a fair amount of anti-Shining Path leftists, even overt communists, were still seen as enemies. **One of the most notorious cases of this was the brutal murder of María Elena Moyano, a feminist and leftist activist who actually worked to better the conditions of the Peruvian people.\[**2\] They also attacked the MRTA, who threatened their precious monopoly on Marxist terrorism.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\_Morello#Shining\_Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello#Shining_Path)

&gt;**Controversially, Morello has on occasion expressed endorsement of the militant Peruvian communist organisation Shining Path. For example, he carries a sticker of the organisation on one of his guitars and in at least one interview he defends the group by deflecting reports on alleged atrocities.**\[90\]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;""If there were instances in which the Shining Path committed atrocities, we're absolutely opposed to that. That is something to be condemned. But would (critics of Rage's stance) be as vehement about the U.S. bombing Belgrade, the Sudan and Afghanistan? It's shocking that people can rationalize one sort of violence but not another.""

Greg Kot, Tribune Rock Critic

CHICAGO TRIBUNE

NOVEMBER 23, 1999

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Perhaps even more controversial is the band's support of Peruvian rebels Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path. Morello has a Shining Path sticker on one of his guitars, and he contends the group is part of peasant uprising against centuries of cruel dictatorship. That's true as far as it goes, but Shining Path is also responsible for slaughtering tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians. Before the group was eviscerated by government forces, it was among the most feared terrorist organizations in the world, according to numerous international human rights agencies.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Question Morello closely about such issues, and he veers away from specifics about Shining Path atrocities and points the finger back at government oppressors: ""It's a case of Peruvians standing up against the U.S. corporations dominating their economy and directing the vast resources of Peru not toward the Peruvian people but toward U.S. pocketbooks. That is the context in which the demonization of the Shining Path can be explained in the U.S. press. If there were instances in which the Shining Path committed atrocities, we're absolutely opposed to that. That is something to be condemned. But would (critics of Rage's stance) be as vehement about the U.S. bombing Belgrade, the Sudan and Afghanistan? It's shocking that people can rationalize one sort of violence but not another.""",Discussion,59.64,9.9

(3)

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start with the good: Democracy and freedom of speech allow for some progress in the formation of a political will and can make it easier to mobilize collective efforts, if the will of the population is in accordance with leadership. Debates about certain topics can allow the state to continuously set itself new goals and allow new people with merit to join and collaborate with the government, set agendas and prevent degeneration of the ruling elites into a corrupt cleptocracy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the bad: Especially nowadays it appears to me that public debate is more and more a matter of individual people showcasing their political identity and narcissism by virtue-signaling and purposefully manufacturing outrage. Lots of people can engage in collective delusions about various topics, where there is virtually no disagreement in expert circles - and they can do so free of consequences, thereby stun-locking society in a permanent debate that never ends and even if it progresses in either direction, the opposing side will simply move the goal-posts and retreat to a new position and spuring on a backlash against the victorious innovation.

Furthermore fixing complicated problems like the health care system in America shouldn't be left to the electorate, as solutions have to be necessarily simplistic in order to garner the required support for it in elections.

&amp;#x200B;

The preliminary solution I propose would be three-fold:

First, I would restrict voting rights and freedom of speech to PhDs or postgraduate degrees and other people who have made a name for themselves in a specific field, such as entrepreneurs and inventors.

Lower sections of the population may vote for a kind of plebeian tribunal that can represent their interests and restrict the elite's grip on the economy, but not partake in trend-setting developments.

This would guarantee that the people can usefully implement their knowledge as directly as possible and the thinned-out electorate cannot easily be targeted by misinformation or moral outrage campaigns and other ailments to rational thought anymore.

Second, I would absolutely regulate the living hell out of social media platforms. No more prioritization of divisive and inflammatory content and content that unilateraly confirms the user's biases, suggestions should entail different viewpoints as well and perhaps even a timecap for usage should be implemented for certain people. People who are bored or think they can save the world can always join a labor corps of their choice.

Third, I would organize and draft members of society into labor corps, where they can themselves vote or choose on what kind of project they would like to work and then be provided with the necessary resources and expertise. Environmentalists can work in wildlife-protection or solar panel construction, socialists can help with constructing beautiful social housing compounds, like the ones in Vienna etc.

In such a way the alienation of common people from practical decisions would be sublated and the population can directly leave its mark on infrastructure and architecture. If successful, participants can earn first-class citizenship or vouchers for higher education.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this topic? Suggestions or other opinions, maybe improvements to my draft?",Topic Discussion,-491.18,217.4

While I economically certainly support third positionism, as I believe a mixed economy is most conducive towards technological progress, I also hold the racial, nationalist, bellicist and puritanian beliefs of Naziism in very low regard to say the least.

I like the idea of having a dynamic and authoritarian system that goes beyond the petty desires of single individuals and organizes them competitively towards greater goals, i.e. work towards the leader's directives, but not a society that arbitrarily excludes people and wastes their human potential on the battlefield or in a slave camp. Every idiot can die for his fatherland, the true challenge is to live and make it better for as long as your body and mind allow it.

Wouldn't it be better to put Nazis in the Auth-Right direction? Is it really economically centrist to enslave and murder millions, who didn't do the society any wrong, just to churn out a couple more cartridges, making the priviledged lazy and the undesirables too destitute to contribute?

To me this just sounds like hierarchy as and end-in-itself and conservatism on steroids. ""State do things"" and them being no big fans of Jesus is not enough for me to call them AuthCenter.

For example, few years back he was nominated as ""najväčší Slovák"" (biggest Slovak) and people went apeshit. After a week they canceled his nomination. Generally, there are two factions, one that supports him strongly, and the other who demonises him. I personally have more of a neutral stance. I think he was in very difficult position and he did what he could or thought was right, ofcourse he was flawed as every man is.

He and his party managed to revive our nation after a very long sleep. There was huge nationalistic sentiment under Austria-Hungary, and many people were dissatisfied with Czech centralism under Czechoslovakia. So you can imagine how huge deal it was when we finally got our own state after more than a thousand years. Yes, we were a puppet of Germany, which was economically abused, we lost our southern lands to Hungary, but we had our own state. You could even argue, that if they didnt manage to prevail at this very time, there would be no Slovak republic.

Here is what I think: With regard to the governmental system I'm moderate auth. There should be a life long ruler with ministers who are appointed based both on expertise and merit but there should also be a constitution with a supreme court that has the right to veto laws and to impeach the leader to avoid tyranny and arbitrary rule.
I am strongly auth when it comes to individual civil liberties. I think freedom of speech should be limited and the media should be under surveillance of the government. Only people who have expertise on a particular topic should be allowed to express their opinion on it in public.
I'm anti drugs, anti porn and for a mandatory healthy and morally correct lifestyle in general. I support the Chinese social credit system.
I'm anti LGBT, anti feminist and support traditional gender roles and the tradtional family. I oppose secual promiscuity and am pro life with exceptions in case of rape, when the child is disabled or when the mother's life is endangered.
I'm in favor of a state religion but I think other religions should be allowed in private as long as they are not in conflict with the ideological values of the state.
I'm a patriot, anti immigration and don't want a multicultural society but an official state culture into which everyone must assimilate. I believe that some cultures are superior but I think that while genes of course do matter to a certain extent, socialization also plays an important role and human nature is way more complex than racial theory can describe.
I'm in favor of extensive police rights and support the death penalty and forced labor.
I am very much pro military and think that militarism and hierarchy should be values of the nation that are actively promoted in school and in daily live. However I am rather isolationist, I think we should only have military alliances with states that are ideologically very similar to our own and war should primarly serve the defense of the nation.
In terms of economics I support state interventionalism and state capitalism. I am in favor of a minimum wage and social welfare programs and think the defence industry, infrastructure, hospitals, research and banks should be nationalized. I support public healthcare and public education.

AuthoritariansDiscuss,Was Mussolini antisemitic,"Was Mussolini antisemitic?

I agree that Italian Fascism didn't have the antisemitic component of AH's NatSoc but, what about this?

[""These disgusting Jews, I must destroy them all,"" Mussolini was quoted as saying by his lover in October **1938**. At another point he calls them ""enemies"" and ""reptiles,"" according to the excerpts.](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna33973018)

 In **1932**, Mussolini made his private attitude about Jews known to the Austrian ambassador when discussing the issue of the antisemitism of Hitler, saying: ""I have no love for the Jews, but they have great influence everywhere. It is better to leave them alone. Hitler's anti-Semitism has already brought him more enemies than is necessary"".

Seems to be opposite of his other statements on jews:

[In an early **1920s**, Mussolini wrote an article which stated that Fascism would never elevate a ""Jewish Question"" and that ""Italy knows no antisemitism and we believe that it will never know it"" and then elaborated ""let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed"".\[30\] ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)#Antisemitism)

[In **1932** during a conversation Emil Ludwig, Mussolini described antisemitism as a ""German vice"" and stated: ""There was 'no Jewish Question' in Italy and could not be one in a country with a healthy system of government"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)#Antisemitism)

I think Mussolini was antisemitic but, similar to the national conservative Miklós Horthy. [For example Horthy admitted to be being an antisemite but, saved hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews from getting Holocausted.](https://momentmag.com/horthy-jews-budapest/)

[Different from the antisemitic NatSoc Arrow Cross Party which murdered thousands of Jews.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Sz%C3%A1lasi)

AuthoritariansDiscuss,Merit based or hereditary power,"Would you prefer the control over society to be inherited or gained through a merit based system? This is for both the roles in the government and for wealth/economics.

Full hereditary would be like a system where certain families have power. Depending on how authoritarian you are then there might be an inherited monarchy too. For money it wouldn't have much restrictions on inheritance, at least for the upper classes. Basically just think of a stereotypical aristocratic monarchy.

Fully merit based would be a meritocracy. Heavy taxes and restrictions on inheritance, if inheritance isn't just outright abolished. Being in the family of a powerful person wouldn't gain you extra powers.

I am personally for a full meritocracy. I see inheritance as one of the main causes of demoralization and the inefficiency of the upper class. The only types of inheritance off the top of my head that is needed are special family objects and businesses. Inheritance of power is just inefficient and oftentimes a cause of exploitation.

Like he would put raper6000 as his twitter username, defend race realism, deny the holocaust, and then have whole mental breakdown over some troll putting spinning sonnenard over some random guy that likes him. Saying that they try to make him look bad.

Then he would call himself anti degeneracy but hang about with catboykami. Would say mexicans should be deported but himself is 1/4 mexican and half of his fans are.

AuthoritariansDiscuss,An announcement about the controversies and rumours surrounding me,"Yes, I am u/YuributRussian. Here is a [cropped image](https://imgur.com/a/sZQRov4) of the front page of my main account. No I do not grill.

The creation of u/ADcommunication was done specifically to try and prevent this sub from being banned (I was also bored). [The first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthoritariansDiscuss/comments/q2x6d0/this_is_a_rant_and_request_coming_from_a_member/) was my primary outline for what I think needed to be said to raise the issue of the more toxic members of this subreddit in terms of beliefs and presentation of said beliefs. Re-read the whole thing because I will not repeat that post here.

I realised that it would not be enough to save the sub, so I started to intentionally antagonise the said toxic members of this subreddit in an attempt to create a divide in the sub. The intention behind this was something of a gamble to show that said members of these communities who would cause this subreddit to be banned, even in the reddit administrators eyes, are a small minority. If said group of genuinely bigoted (and trust me, I don't like you) members were a small minority then this may have given the mod extra time to implement reforms. The comment requesting time on AHS by [u/thisisaNORMALname](https://www.reddit.com/u/thisisaNORMALname/) passed censors, so I assumed that we had a chance at some form of appeasement to keep this sub alive. Whether you like it or not, the purpose of this sub is discussion and the removal of certain users would have little ramifications on that aspect.

The incriminating evidence of me being on AHS was a red herring for AHS to assume that I was on their side as a mediator. It was also a red herring for all of you to ease my plans of division, I doubted that it would take very long for people to notice, so I posted far more per day than I usually would here. The post below;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/q3krb7/how\_do\_you\_archive\_posts\_i\_fear\_that\_if\_i\_bring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/q3krb7/how_do_you_archive_posts_i_fear_that_if_i_bring/)

was one such example of a red herring.

The content archived by actual AHS members [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/q1fkzx/rauthoritariansdiscuss_an_openlyfascist_hate_sub/) is more than enough to ban the entire subreddit and by extension everyone on it permanently. There would be no point to this elaborate play of infiltrating this sub to post and comment hateful content when they already have enough to make a judgement. For some of the people accusing me of trying to get the sub banned, you do more than enough fedposting/commenting individually to do the job for someone with those intentions.

The division of the subreddit that would show admins that the problem group are a small percentage was the only way for this subreddit to survive. Committing an action and leaving a bunch of evidence around to prove that you did it doesn't suddenly go away because you don't go outside after you've done it. The same can be said for violating ToS and making a subreddit go private. I've heard so many people such as u/zmasterv_2 and u/RandomNumbers98 talk about ""unity"" as if that will somehow save this sub. For someone who likes to talk about standing proud like a ""[lion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthoritariansDiscuss/comments/q3uwmq/this_poll_will_be_the_final_nail_in_the_coffin_of/hfubow3/?context=3)"" you don't seem to realise that you are resigning everyone in this sub to being the sheep to be slaughtered, yourself included.

What makes you people so confident that we wont get banned by ""living as a lion""?

1. We don't bring in a significant amount of money for reddit. Removing us has no negative effect on reddit.
2. We have violated Tos.
3. The violation in question is the kind that reddit would want to remove due to PR

That being said though, that's no reason to start pointing fingers at who's fault it is.

If anything, we now have more-of a reason not to start infighting. The more we infight, the easier it will be for Reddit antifas to take this sub down. Instead, we should work together to resolve this issue.

And admit it, this type of sub isn't the one that would last long (without going private). Sooner or later, AHS would've tried to ban it.

Even if that wasn't the case, what happened happened. We can't change anything that happened in the past, but we can try to make the situation better, by simply stopping with this infighting nonsense.

AuthoritariansDiscuss,This is a rant and request coming from a member of the sub who was banned from the site,"u/thisisaNORMALname  I am fully aware that this is a violation of the sub rules, but I have to state it anyway.

THIS SUB IS r/AuthoritariansDiscuss, not r/shitposting or any sort of culturally alt-right meme sub. What part of ""discuss"" in the name do you people, the many accounts of u/BasedNRedpilled especially, not understand? If you want this sub to not just thrive but even survive in the first place be civil and frame your opinions in the most logically concise manner possible with as little hatred as possible. Going to call out another User, u/Zmasterv also needs to chill the fuck out. Other than the misuse of based, you always frame concepts that are even slightly progressive or libertarian as being wholly degenerate and worthy of death. The AHS archives has a permanent record of this and shows that the concept of discussion can only be pried out of you when concepts are spoon fed to you.

DON'T BRIGADE THIS SUB, [https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/q1fkzx/rauthoritariansdiscuss\_an\_openlyfascist\_hate\_sub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/q1fkzx/rauthoritariansdiscuss_an_openlyfascist_hate_sub/)

You people don't help with making the reputation of this sub, and to a greater extent the representation of the political systems you want to implement, look any better with the shit in these threads. The two users in the first paragraph make this considerably worse. AHS advocates for the banning of every participant in a sub they deem hateful. If I get my main account back before this sub is banned (waiting for a appeal), I will be amongst those lost because of a handful of users. The same can be said for most users of this sub. [u/Kuro199](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kuro199/) should be considered the model user for the rest of you, not filled with fire and brimstone in beliefs and presentation.

This sub is one of the few places where these authoritarian concepts can be explored, free from the socially liberal subreddit mods who have a pseudo-enforced ""No authoritarian rule"" in place. I am grateful for u/thisisaNORMALname being so generous to allow discussion, but a thorough examination of how rule 14 is not being applied is ***NEEDED***. For a Sub of authoritarians we are quite demanding of our personal freedom, and are not willing to make simple compromises of etiquette for everyone, including the sub's survival. I disagree with many of the people here, but I want to hear your opinions too. Politeness will go a long way for all of us in many, many ways.

I request for this sub to:

* Make a firm statement about the do's and don'ts relating to rule 14, keeping our future on a leash from jumping off a cliff.
* For the subreddit to be made private. (temporarily)
* Remove the problem users who are drawing us so much controversy.
* Possibly make an approval of posts before being visible. With the level of traffic this sub gets, the last should be easy.

This is just for the survival of the sub and all those who have contributed to it.

If u/thisisaNORMALname wants to chat I would be happy to, I will also reveal which user I am if it happens. The same goes for a hypothetical AHS user who would be willing to know the specifics of this sub to make a specified ultimatum for this sub's survival. In the subs current state, we the people and the sub are doomed for permanent banning.",Subreddit Discussion,86.03,6.0

Based **DOES NOT** mean I agree with you, cringe **DOES NOT** mean I disagree with you.

What based actually means in terms of r/PoliticalCompassMemes definition (which is where most of us developed such language) is that someone holds an opinion that is:

1. Controversial
2. Logically consistent with itself
3. Something that the holder of the opinion is willing to defend without faulting on the idea's themselves due to digital peer pressure.

Cringe is:

1. Mellow **OR** lacking in depth
2. Inconsistent with its own standards
3. Something that the holder of the opinion is willing to change or abandon simply for popularity, specifically taking away an aspect that is required for other parts to function.

The status of based and cringe must fulfil all requirements to be considered as such. Just because someone's opinion is boring doesn't mean they are cringe. Racism is pretty cringe because the basis of it has the depth of a mud puddle in terms of logic and evidence. A person with surface level opinions isn't necessarily cringe, they're are likely just not as political as you, and their opinions are functionally preferences.",Subreddit Discussion,-123.07,80.1

AuthoritariansDiscuss,What are all of you guys thoughts on this quote from a site dedicated to Oswald Mosley Basically employee run businesses once a company gets to a certain size rather than state run or privately run,"[https://www.oswaldmosley.com/the-age-of-leisure/](https://www.oswaldmosley.com/the-age-of-leisure/)

&gt; **Mosley had the answer years ago.**
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;Instead of companies being owned by the state or by absentee shareholders, every company above a certain size should be owned corporately by its employees. Present shareholders would be paid off and every employee would become a stakeholder in the firm they work for. All profits would be distributed to them alone according to individual skill and responsibility and all major decisions decided by them or their elected representatives. ‘Industrial democracy’ would become a reality for millions of British and European working people for the first time.
&gt;
&gt;Mosley’s Wage-Price Mechanism would then ensure that as technology increases productivity, wages would be increased correspondingly – not only in the service of social justice but to ensure that the purchasing power of the market is sufficient to guarantee that all goods and services are sold. Thus supply will always be equalled by demand so ending the causes of slump, recession, deflation and inflation.

What do you all think of this economic system? It's a version of National Syndicalism that is closer to Market Socialism than it is to Corporatism. I don't think I could get 100% behind it personally, but if it proved to be efficient, more so than Corporatism, then I would be perfectly fine with it.",Topic Discussion,51.86,15.0

[According to le democracy index, they are all democracies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) Is it possible to be democratic AND authoritarian?

They are not as authoritarian as DPRK or Saudi Arabia but, I don't think they are as democratic as Norway either.

Poland is restricting rule of law, Singapore has little press freedom, and Israel is frequently accused of being ""fascist"" regarding their treatment of Palestinians...   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I don't have a personal thing against degeneracy other than my hatred for Zoophilia, as well as certain predispositions about certain topics in which A scenario has to be proven to be okay for me to accept it. There are others that I can't think of right now, but I probably do have them.

AuthoritariansDiscuss,Operation Preservation a plan to Preserve the Legacy of the Subreddit in case of AHS raid,"The operation is pretty simple and consists of 2 Steps

1 - the moment AHS makes a post about the Sub, immediately start downloading as much memes and images as you can using the Reddit Download Image Function, after you have downloaded all the Images and memes, start screenshotting discussions, questions, polls and opinions as well, don't stop until either the sub is banned or there is nothing more to screenshot

2 - Post all of it on an Archive Sub with the Sole Goal of conserving the legacy of the Sub, some possible names include r/AuthoritarianArchive (although that would be too simple and easy too find by AHS, so ideally the name of the Sub would be more subtle and hard to find)

Questions -

""What if the Sub doesn't get banned?""

What if it does? It's always good to be prepared for all situations, I like to say hope for the best and prepare for the worst

""This is too complicated and will take too much effort, I couldn't do it alone""

You wouldn't do it alone, I would make a post here telling that the Operation has begun after AHS makes a post about this sub, lots of people would be involved on the Operation, thus speeding it out

""But what if two or more persons download the same image and then both of them post it on the Archive Sub?""

AuthoritariansDiscuss,Thoughts on this text,"The music,art,etc,... of the modern day United States seems so bland,monotone and materialistic,and it has been like this since either 70s or 80s I believe. Most other countries have actual traditions and customs that are many centuries old and are genuinely enjoyed by most of the population. However,in modern America,people don't have any actual,conventional culture;instead,they have a degenerate anti-culture which is based purely on being as repulsive as possible.

Let me explain in a more detailed manner:

Here's an example;let's say you have a company that wants to promote some ""popular music"" in exchange for money. Now,depending on the time when this imaginary company would be producing its art or music,the way it would actually have to plan out the way it would fulfill its goals would be drastically different;

For example,in the 50s and 60s,America was made up of several smaller local cultures,which all differed in their customs. The ""popular music"" in,say,Jacksonville Tennessee,would be a separate collection of genres from the ""popular music"" in Chicago,Illinois or something. Back then,such a company would have to produce different types of music depending on where the company itself had the most influence. However,in the past few decades  (which in my opinion started in the early 70s),the dozens of smaller local cultures in America have started to become replaced by a single monoculture which is basically built on the idea of constant materialistic consumerism and hedonism. But the worst part is that this new anti-culture is not even staying inside America;it's spreading its influence and ""exporting"" itself across the world,basically to the point that we are at the brink of all semblance of culture being obliterated and replaced by a single global monoculture. In some of its aspects,this new monoculture is also somewhat depraved morally;examples are some modern art and music which they promote,and also the political methods of how they deal with social issues and promote nonsensical ideologies and dogmas constantly. A very important aspect of this ""degenerate"" (as some might call it) behavior is an obsession with sexual hedonism,which is expressed in many different ways,along with (not just sexual) consumeristic hedonism in general.


*""What can be done to slow the anticulture down?""*

The best way,on an individual level,to prevent,or at the very least slow down,these types of events,is to try and create and participate in actual local customs and traditions;attending ceremonies and community events,participating in activities with our local communities and towns,consuming conventional art,music and other actual *culture*,etc,...

AuthoritariansDiscuss,What is your opinion on eugenics,"A pretty good definition of eugenics I found for those that don't know what it is:

&gt;Eugenics takes influence from the Darwinian theory of evolution, which states that organisms develop to better suit a given environment through the gradual dying of organisms that are unsuited to the environment before they can reproduce and applies them to Humans; this is done by selecting traits which are 'desirable' and artificially adjusting the environment to either maximise the reproduction of those with those traits (positive eugenics) or minimising the reproduction of those with undesirable traits (negative eugenics).

Eugenics can be done by aborting people who will have undesirable traits, sterilizing people who's kids could inherit undesirable traits, or even just killing people with undesirable traits. Another form of eugenics is using technology to genetically modify people to have more desirable traits. The whole point of it is that some traits are desirable, and some aren't. It's basically trying to maximize efficiency, though some will say through immoral ways.

It's all very interesting and I want to know what you all think about it, and if you would support something like this in your ideal nation.

I had a very rough childhood, so the music I preferred was very angry and chaotic. I later realized the music I selected often perpetuated negative emotion, which didn’t help my angst and anger in the least.

These days (I’m just shy of 42), I don’t play music very often for a few reasons:

1. I don’t want songs/music playing in my head all the time. To me, that’s an addictive response, and just because it doesn’t destroy our bodies doesn’t mean it can’t cripple our minds.

2. Allowing someone else to control my emotions with what they’ve created should be a highly selective process and determination. The influence of mood should be based on intent, not just a hedonistic response from pleasure senses.

3. I seldom listen to anything for lyrical content. I do listen to music with lyrics, but the vocals, to me, are just another instrument on most occasions. I will listen to lyrics if I feel it will enhance my desired mood, thereby promoting my intent. For example, I often listen to tribal and militant music when working out, typically with lyrics based on warrior culture.

I feel that this ties to authoritarian discussion because authoritarianism is, by default, embedded in order both internally and externally. Music can, and does, influence both.

Some examples of what I like are:

- Lorn: One of my favorite artists. Mysterious and dark electronic ambient sounds, sometimes with lyrics that are difficult to even understand because of masking, but it contributes to the effect of the sounds. Often listened to when feeling creative.

- Heilung: Another favorite, and I’ve no idea what they’re saying because the songs aren’t in English. Very tribal sounds that grab primitive responses from the subconscious; reminds me that we are truly fantastic creatures of complexity founded in primal origins. Often listened to when breaking from exhaustive deep thought, or when working out.

- Arditi: Martial Industrial with lyrics I don’t mind, promoting a sense of glorification of human capabilities, achievement, and duty to oneself and society. Often listened to when traveling or doing homework.

People know what they want or need, they just dont know how to get it. Thats what politicians are for - to guide them, but people should be the raw emotion which forces the whole structure to move. Not some withdrawn entrenched elite, whose biggest achievement in life was that he was born well and he wants to keep it that way. Economical elites dont care about the welfare of nation, morality or quality of life in the country. But people do.

And populism is great tool for changing status quo and uniting people. Because most populist movements are not extreme enough to scare off moderates or push ""opposing teams"" (retarded left right divide), which gives them huge advantage. And you may even change the status quo legally! I would even dare to say, that at this very moment, populism is the most realistic way how the current status quo can be changed.

Big critique of populist movements is that they become corrupted...which political movement or politician isnt? Corruption is tool of power which will be used, you cant stop that. Only reduce it so it isnt hurting public finances too much. As long as the power isnt too centralised, it shouldnt be too big problem.

Most other countries have actual traditions and customs that are many centuries old and are genuinely enjoyed by most of the population. However,in modern America,people don't have any actual,conventional culture;instead,they have a degenerate anti-culture which is based purely on being as repulsive as possible.

Let me explain in a more detailed manner:

Here's an example;let's say you have a company that wants to promote some ""popular music"" in exchange for money. Now,depending on the time when this imaginary company would be producing its art or music,the way it would actually have to plan out the way it would fulfill its goals would be drastically different;

For example,in the 50s and 60s,America was made up of several smaller local cultures,which all differed in their customs. The ""popular music"" in,say,Jacksonville Tennessee,would be a separate collection of genres from the ""popular music"" in Chicago,Illinois or something. Back then,such a company would have to produce different types of music depending on where the company itself had the most influence. However,in the past few decades  (which in my opinion started in the early 70s),the dozens of smaller local cultures in America have started to become replaced by a single monoculture which is basically built on the idea of constant materialistic consumerism and hedonism. But the worst part is that this new anti-culture is not even staying inside America;it's spreading its influence and ""exporting"" itself across the world,basically to the point that we are at the brink of all semblance of culture being obliterated and replaced by a single global monoculture. In some of its aspects,this new monoculture is also somewhat depraved morally;examples are some modern art and music which they promote,and also the political methods of how they deal with social issues and promote nonsensical ideologies and dogmas constantly. A very important aspect of this ""degenerate"" (as some might call it) behavior is an obsession with sexual hedonism,which is expressed in many different ways,along with (not just sexual) consumeristic hedonism in general.


*""What can be done to slow the anticulture down?""*

The best way,on an individual level,to prevent,or at the very least slow down,these types of events,is to try and create and participate in actual local customs and traditions;attending ceremonies and community events,participating in activities with our local communities and towns,consuming conventional art,music and other actual *culture*,etc,...

This is the post about the character in my fictional story I made a while ago,and I have already discussed him and other characters several times previously. However,now I have a question specifically about his economic system known as *clanism*,about which I will explain more now:

""Clanism"",as mentioned,was neither a left wing nor a right wing economic system,as it divided the population into various social classes (""clans"") based on their shared interests or skills,involving science,agriculture,military,labor,economy and other important societal functions. In classical Odarian Vardism,Mazorin promoted clanism as a central component of vardism's opposition to both ""financism"" (this world's term for right wing economics) and ""unitism"" (this world's term for left wing economics),and actively started promoting these programs in 917. Many other vardist and nationalist dictators also embraced this system,including the ruler of the nation of Beldukal,and his neighbor Vrangego Vrangi (892-978)(Ruler 927-978),who ruled the country of Zbaidar. Such a form of economics is,within this world,almost exclusively associated with vardism and Mazorin,although many other more moderate small populist movements sometimes continue to promote it.",Topic Discussion,75.2,6.0

AuthoritariansDiscuss,How AnarchistFundamentalists attempted to eradicate Religion Prostitution Alcohol Tobacco and even Coffee during the Revolutionary period in Spanish history,"""Nor did the ""freedom"" so acclaimed by the Anarchist militants include the freedom to use alcohol, tobacco, or sometimes even coffee. As Bolloten explains, ""Puritanism was a characteristic of the libertarian movement. According to George Esenwein, an authority on Spanish Anarchism, puritanism was 'one of the several strands of anarchist ideology that can be traced from the beginning of the movement in 1868 up to the Civil War. This tendency, which sprang from the recognition of a moral dichotomy between the proletariat and the middle classes, advocated above all a lifestyle unfettered by materialistic values. Thus excessive drinking, smoking and other practices that were perceived as middle-class attributes were nearly always censured."" While prohibition of hated substances appears to have occurred in only some of the rural collectives, it was the Anarchist prohibitionists who felt themselves to be the purists, rather than their more tolerant comrades. The Spanish Anarchists not only denied their opponents the right to their beliefs; they also denied their presumed supporters the right to control their own bodies. For the Anarchists, it is enough to say that allowing this or that has bad consequences, hence it must be stopped; they never consider the possibility that people have the right to do many things regardless of their bad consequences.

In spite of their advocacy of ""free love,"" the Spanish Anarchists were not tolerant on sexual matters either. The purists crusaded against prostitution, once again revealing their paternalism and intolerance. ""My own personal recollection,"" writes Bolloten, ""is that middle-class Spaniards scoffed at the Anarchists who closed down the brothels in the cities and put the prostitutes to useful work. But for Anarchist purists the cleaning up of society was an article of faith. In his oral history, Ronald Fraser tells of the young Eduardo Pons Prades who... heard the men discussing what had to be done: '""Listen, what about all the people who work in these dens of iniquity?"" ""We've got to redeem them, educate them so they can have the chance of doing something more worthy."" ""Have you asked them if they want to be redeemed?"" ""How can you be so stupid? Would you like to be exploited in that sort of den?"" ""No, of course not. But after years at the same place, it's hard to change."" ""Well, they'll have to. The revolution's first duty is to clean up the place, clean up the people's consciousness."" The important fact to notice is that the purists want to force everyone to live as the see fit, while the pragmatists find the purists' behavior impolitic. One might think that if the purists valued ""freedom"" above all else, they would insist that women cannot be forced to refrain from having sex for money.

I would never presume to tell people how they may or may not use words; I do however reserve the right to re-translates non-standard usages back into plain English. The Spanish Anarchists had no love of ""freedom"" in the ordinary sense of the word. The ""freedom"" of the Spanish Anarchists was the ""freedom"" to live exactly as the Spanish Anarchists thought right.

Many of the Spanish Anarchists were genuinely anti-statist in the standard sense of the word. But since European anarchism was essentially an offshoot of European state-socialism, the Spanish anarchists had almost no anti-state tradition upon which to build. Like the state-socialists, the Spanish anarchists were barely even aware of the long-standing anti-statist liberal tradition, which might have at least stirred them to think about what it is to be free. Ludwig von Mises' Liberalism , published a mere nine years before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, states:

""Liberalism demands tolerance as a matter of principle, not from opportunism. It demands toleration even of obviously nonsensical teachings, absurd forms of heterodoxy, and childishly silly superstitions. It demands toleration for doctrines and opinions that it deems detrimental and ruinous to society and even for movements that it indefatigably combats... Against what is stupid, nonsensical, erroneous, and evil, liberalism fights with the weapons of the mind, and not with brute force and repression.""

Insofar as the European anarchists were (and are) acquianted with classical liberalism, they frequently derided the ""narrowness"" of the classical liberal view of freedom. Liberals insist merely upon the right to be free of physical coercion against person and property, while ignoring the many other kinds of domination in society. Thus, the liberals ignore the ideological domination of the church, the sexual domination of women, the capitalists' domination of workers, the domination of the mind by drug and alcohol addiction.

The theoretical problem that the Spanish Anarchists did not confront is straightforward. Once you declare unpleasant but non-violent acts to be ""domination,"" you implicitly justify using violence to stop them. If Catholicism is ""domination,"" then surely killing priests is a form of self-defense. If prostitution is ""domination,"" then closing the brothels and making prostitutes take up another line of work is actually a form of liberation. If wage-labor is ""domination,"" then forbidding a person to hire an eager worker (even a worker with the option of working for a large collective farm) actually saves the worker from victimization. What is the pattern here? By expanding the meaning of ""domination"" to include almost everything, you actually leave people with no freedom at all. All that remains is the Orwellian freedom to live precisely as the Anarchist council thinks right.

If ""freedom"" means anything at all, it must leave open the freedom to perform many immoral actions without punishment. Words can hurt other people's feelings, or humiliate them, or convince them to devote their lives to follies. But if anything is not ""domination"" or ""coercion,"" it is speaking your mind to the world.

Likewise, if a person must devote their life to a cause, or else face punishment, they are not free. If a person must join the war against Franco, or care for the needy, or make the collective successful - or face prison or execution - they are not free. They are not free even if the cause to which they must dedicate their life is noble, just, and right.

The Spanish Anarchists loved the words ""liberty"" and ""freedom,"" but they did not love them enough to think deeply about them. They assumed that their application was obvious; there was no need to make a list of what people should and should not be free to do. Instead, the Spanish Anarchists focused upon what they thought free people ought to do. They did not spend a great deal of time thinking about how to treat people who planned on using their freedom differently. Either they assumed that a bizarre degree of unanimity would prevail once the state was abolished; or they planned to kill all dissenters until unanimity was achieved; or, most likely of all, they were too emotional to think about the issue.""

In order to achieve the aforementioned goal, my recommendations are the following:

• The instigation of term limits, presidential, judicial and legislative, in order to prevent career politicians from spawinig, only caring about amassing influence and trying to stay in power eternally.

• The option to recall any legislator, judge or politician by the people via a national referendum, if there's strong evidence of any wrongdoing.

• The capability to impeach the president(or the prime minister), justices, or policymakers if there are any misdeeds that they have committed.

• A complete and total prohibition of donations to political campaigns by rich, interconnected mega-donors and the dismantling of political abominations such as super-PAC's, lobbying groups or political activist foundations/organizations.

• More transparency in government, harsh penalties for money laundering, mandation for all politicians and the president(or the prime minister)to release their tax returns at the end of every legislative year and notification to the anti-corruption committee if any parliamentarian meets with an activist/interest group outiside of congressional sessions.

• The creation of a robust and effective national anti-corruption office that utilizes the last possible technological innovations in forensic science to catch the lawbreakers swiftly and effectively.

• An end to the system of parliamentary immunity and statutes of limitations, politicians are not above the law, nobody is, they shouldn't be immune from prosecution or investigation if there's any suspicion of them violating the legal norms.

• Better cooperation between the constituent police departments and the judiciary in order to more effectively coordinate the state's efforts in countering and punishing corruption.

• A national crackdown on the mafia, organized crime groups, drug trafficking, human/sex trafficking, arms trafficking, organ trafficking or other illicit activities and rapid investigation of any politician or justice connected to such activities.

• End the toleration of tax heavens and corporate corruption practices, investigate banks and corporations for money laundering, tax evasion, abuse of labour legislation or their supply chains in foreign countries.

• The encampment of a national culture and conversation that discourages corruption and instills an ethical framework in the populace, eventually thinking twice before breaking the law.

• The development of a prestigious and a quality education system, with excellent teachers and professors who care about their pupils and are willing to instill proper pro-social values and the necessary skills needed to succeed in the modern world.

• An end to the immunity and privileges that terrible teachers and professors enjoy today due to corrupt labour union practices, tenurement traditions and other working contracts and the immediate dismissal and replacement of such individuals with other more qualified ones in order to achieve this essential and dignified objective.",Subreddit Discussion,-450.25,197.5

Furthermore, every single Communist/Socialist state across history has been immensely Consevative in regards to social issues, with China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Venezuela and Nicaragua constituting some modern examples.

Conversely, a big chunk of self-proclaimed National-Socialists and Fascists alike have generally identified as Atheists or Irreligious.

Richard Spencer, the founder of the current Alt-Right movement, Stormfront(e.g the largest Neo-Nazi forum on the internet)as well as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, are some striking examples of Authoritarian/Socially-Conservative Atheists or Irreligious individuals.

Moreover, even if you wish to include Democratic nations such as Japan, Czech Republic or India you would probably find strong Socially-Conservative elements amongst their societies, in spite of the aforementioned countries being some of the least Religious in the world.

Seriously, I have been plagued with the above question concurrently, does there exist some secret ""ingredient"" that ""attracts"" confirmed Atheists towards Authoritarian ideals, or simply Authoritarian-minded individuals tend to be more Socially-Conservative in comparison to the rest of the population, regardless of the Religious beliefs in practice?",Question,-169.43,87.6

Fascists, Monarchists, authoritarian-commies, and everyone in between didn't get along, even though a lot of us agree with how corrupt and flawed todays system is. We also both hate cringey liberals and anarkiddies, but how could we unify?

As a Mosley fan, I like the idea of isolationism. I don't care what's going on over in Russia or Spain or anywhere else, the country is the first priority, the rest of the world is none of my concern unless it clearly affects our nation and our people. This idea doesn't necessarily apply to other auths, like national socialists perhaps, who want all Germanic peoples under one state. This also doesn't apply to some communists as they believe they must export the revolution across the world (Stalinists aren't included since they support communism in just one state)

I want Auths to get along, we mainly just differ on economics, but our views on current day society are indistinguishable, and to me, that's what matters. Economics is kind of like a science. I don't think someone is a bad person for believing in a wrong scientific theory as long as they are genuine with their belief. The core values between all auths are very similar, and that's what truly matters in my eyes.
